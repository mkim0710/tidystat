### **2\. Check Network Firewall Settings**

Firewalls can block incoming connections from external networks:

-   **Router Firewall**:
    
    -   Access your router's firewall settings.
    -   Ensure that incoming connections on port `65087` are allowed.
    -   If your router supports it, add a firewall rule to permit incoming traffic on port `65087` to `192.168.0.224`.
-   **Work PC Firewall**:
    
    -   **Windows Firewall**:
        
        -   Open the Windows Security settings.
            
        -   Navigate to **Firewall & network protection**.
            
        -   Click on **Advanced settings** to open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.
            
        -   Check **Inbound Rules** for a rule that allows incoming traffic on port `65087`.
            
        -   If no such rule exists, create a new inbound rule:
            
            -   **Rule Type**: Port
            -   **Protocol**: TCP
            -   **Port Number**: `65087`
            -   **Action**: Allow the connection
            -   **Profile**: Domain, Private, and Public
            -   **Name**: RStudio Server Port 65087
    -   **Third-Party Firewalls**:
        
        -   If other security software is installed (e.g., Norton, McAfee), ensure that they are not blocking the port.
        
        
### **3\. Confirm External Accessibility**

-   **Test from Home**:
    
    -   Open a web browser on your home PC.
    -   Navigate to `http://147.46.170.167:65087`.
    -   Observe if the page loads, partially loads, or if there's a timeout.
-   **Ping and Traceroute**:
    
    -   **Ping**:
        
        -   Open Command Prompt or Terminal on your home PC.
        -   Run `ping 147.46.170.167`.
        -   Note that some networks disable ping responses; a failure doesn't necessarily mean the host is unreachable.
    -   **Traceroute**:
        
        -   Run `tracert 147.46.170.167` (Windows) or `traceroute 147.46.170.167` (macOS/Linux).
        -   This will show the path your connection takes and where it might be slowing down or failing.


### **7\. Implement Secure Remote Access Solutions**

If direct access over the internet remains problematic due to network policies or security concerns, consider alternative methods:

-   **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:
    
    -   Set up a VPN server on your work network.
        
    -   Connect to the VPN from home to securely access network resources as if you were on the local network.
        
    -   **Advantages**:
        
        -   Encrypted connection enhances security.
        -   Bypasses many firewall and NAT issues.
    -   **Considerations**:
        
        -   Requires configuration on both the server and client sides.
        -   May need approval from your organization's IT department.
-   **Secure Shell (SSH) Tunneling**:
    
    -   Use SSH to create a secure tunnel to your work PC.
        
    -   Forward local ports to remote ports over the SSH connection.
        
    -   **Steps**:
        
        -   Install an SSH server on your work PC (e.g., OpenSSH for Windows).
        -   From your home PC, use an SSH client (e.g., PuTTY) to connect to the SSH server.
        -   Set up port forwarding in the SSH client to map a local port to `localhost:65087` on the work PC.
    -   **Advantages**:
        
        -   Adds encryption and security.
        -   Does not require changes to router settings if SSH port (usually `22`) is open.
    -   **Considerations**:
        
        -   SSH port may also be blocked by firewalls.
        -   Requires some technical knowledge to set up.
