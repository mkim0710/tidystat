# .Renviron, the primary purpose of which is to set environment variables. These tell R where to find external programs and can hold user-specific information than needs to be kept secret, typically API keys.
# .Rprofile is a plain text file (which is always called .Rprofile, hence its name) that simply runs lines of R code every time R starts. If you want R to check for package updates each time it starts (as explained in the previous section), you simply add the relevant line somewhere in this file.
# When R starts (unless it was launched with --no-environ) it first searches for .Renviron and then .Rprofile, in that order. 
# Files in three folders are important in this process:
# R_HOME, the directory in which R is installed. The etc sub-directory can contain start-up files read early on in the start-up process. Find out where your R_HOME is with the R.home() command.
# HOME, the user’s home directory. Typically this is /home/username on Unix machines or C:\Users\username on Windows (since Windows 7). Ask R where your home directory is with, Sys.getenv("HOME").
# R’s current working directory. This is reported by getwd().
# It is important to know the location of the .Rprofile and .Renviron set-up files that are being used out of these three options. R only uses one .Rprofile and one .Renviron in any session: if you have a .Rprofile file in your current project, R will ignore .Rprofile in R_HOME and HOME. Likewise, .Rprofile in HOME overrides .Rprofile in R_HOME. The same applies to .Renviron: you should remember that adding project specific environment variables with .Renviron will de-activate other .Renviron files.
# To create a project-specific start-up script, simply create a .Rprofile file in the project’s root directory and start adding R code, e.g. via file.edit(".Rprofile"). Remember that this will make .Rprofile in the home directory be ignored. The following commands will open your .Rprofile from within an R editor:

# You can customize the R environment through a site initialization file or a directory initialization file.
# R will always source the Rprofile.site file first. On Windows, the file is in the C:\Program Files\R\R-n.n.n\etc directory. You can also place a .Rprofile file in any directory that you are going to run R from or in the user home directory.
# At startup, R will source the Rprofile.site file. It will then look for a . Rprofile file to source in the current working directory. If it doesn't find it, it will look for one in the user's home directory. 
# There are two special functions you can place in these files. .First( ) will be run at the start of the R session and .Last( ) will be run at the end of the session.
