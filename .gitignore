# .gitignore is case-sensitive by default, but behavior may vary based on your filesystem. 
# To configure git to ignore case, run the following command:
# git config core.ignorecase true
#|________________________________________________________________________________|#  
#|%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%|#  
# * When a file matches both the global and project .gitignore: The project .gitignore overrides the global .gitignore
# * When a file matches only the global .gitignore: If the project .gitignore has no explicitly matching pattern, the global .gitignore rule takes effect. (Caution~!!!)
#|________________________________________________________________________________|#  
#|%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%|#  
# Caution) Different from RegEx~!! (especially be cautious with the question mark (?))
# ab        : The the exact string "ab", either in file name or directory name. There should be no other characters before or after the string. (Caution: does not match "ab.xy" nor "xy.ab". Does match "ab/xy"?? Does match "xy/ab"??)
# [Aa][Bb]  : The string "ab", case ignored, either in the file name or the directory name. There should be no other characters before or after the string. (Caution: does not match "ab.xy" nor "xy.ab". Does match "ab/xy"?? Does match "xy/ab"??)
# *         : The asterisk(*) means "any character" zero or more times (Cf. In RegEx, the aristerisk (*) means "zero or more times" of the PRECEDING CHARACTER.)
# .*        : Litteral dot(.), followed by "any character" zero or more times. (Caution: does not match "ab.c". Does match ".gitignore")
# ab*       : The exact string "ab" followed by any characters, either in file name or directory name. There should be no other characters before the string. (Caution: Does not match "a" as in RegEx. Does match "ab.xy". Does match "abc/xy")
# ?         : The question mark(?) means "any character" EXACTLY ONE TIME. (Cf. In RegEx, the question mark(?) means "zero or one time" of the PRECEDING CHARACTER.)
# .?        : Litteral dot(.), followed by "any character" EXACTLY ONE TIME. (Caution: Does not match "c" as in RegEx. Does not match "." as in RegEx. Does match ".c".)
# [Aa]?     : The character "a", case ignored, followed by "any character" EXACTLY ONE TIME. (Caution: Does not match "a" as in RegEx. Does match "ab".)
# a?b       : The character "a", followed by "any character" EXACTLY ONE TIME, followed by "b". (Caution: Does not match "ab" as in RegEx. Does not match "b" as in RegEx. Does match "axb". Does match "a.b".)

# Literal Matches: Simple file or directory names can be ignored directly.
# file.txt
# directory/
# Wildcard Matches: The * wildcard matches zero or more characters.
# *.log          -> Matches any file ending with .log
# temp*          -> Matches any file starting with temp
# Directory Matches: Adding a trailing slash / indicates a directory.
# logs/          -> Ignores the logs directory
# Negation: Patterns can be negated by starting with an exclamation mark !.
# !important.log -> Do not ignore important.log even if *.log is ignored
# Glob Patterns: ** matches directories recursively.
# **/temp        -> Matches temp files in any directory
# Comments: Lines starting with # are comments. 
# This is a comment
# Caution: Comments must start with # at the beginning of the line or after optional whitespace.
# in the middle of a line does not create a comment.
# *** Important) even if a file type is ignored, it can be forced to be tracked by:
# git add -f specific_filename.ext
# *** Important) even if a commit ignored, it can be forced to be tracked by:
# git add -f specific_filename.ext

# *** Let's just use pre-commit hook for file sizes only.
# *** For binary data files, let's just ignore, and search for files intermittently (maybe make a custom git status --ignored?)

# find . -type f | git check-ignore --stdin -v  # For a recursive list including subdirectories, including files in subdirectories not picked up by standard glob patterns.
