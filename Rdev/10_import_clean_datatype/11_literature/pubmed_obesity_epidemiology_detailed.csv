"39360455","Lower serum LH level was related to poor embryo quality and adverse pregnancy outcomes in fixed GnRH antagonist protocol with estradiol pretreatment.","To disclose the relationships between serum LH and reproductive outcomes in Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol pretreated with luteal estradiol. 371 patients, pretreated with estradiol, followed the GnRH antagonist protocol. They were divided into four groups based on the quartiles of serum LH levels on the day of gonadotropin (Gn) initiation(LHGI) and trigger (LHtrigger). Data on various pregnancy outcomes were collected. As serum LHGI increased, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level, antral follicle count (AFC), LHtrigger, estradiol (E2) and P on the trigger day, E2/oocytes, and oocyte numbers increased and peaked in Q4, while Gn dose decreased. Good-quality embryo and blast formation rates increased and peaked in Q3. LHGI <3.93 mIU/ml impaired ongoing pregnancy rate and LBR. After adjusting for AMH and AFC, the impacts were not significant. As LHtrigger increased, E2/oocytes and good-quality embryo rate increased and peaked in T4 and implantation rate increased and peaked in T3. LHtrigger <1.49 mIU/ml independently influenced clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) after adjusting for AMH and AFC. LHGI was positively related to AMH, AFC, LHtrigger, blast formation rate and negatively related to BMI, age and Gn dose. LHtrigger was positively related to E2/oocytes and good quality embryo rate. Lower serum LH represents as a potential indicator for embryo quality and reproductive outcomes in GnRH antagonist fixed protocol pretreated with estradiol. Early identification of excessive suppression of LH levels will benefit individuals with normal ovarian reserve more.","Ying Chen, Yizhe Li, Xu Li, Linhong Liu, Zhen Liu, Wenwu Gui, Xiru Liu, Ying Chen","Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology","2024Dec","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Estradiol; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Adult; Luteinizing Hormone; Ovulation Induction; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy Rate; Hormone Antagonists; Retrospective Studies; Fertilization in Vitro; Anti-Mullerian Hormone"
"39360447","Investigation of 5-fluorouracil cardiotoxicity in combinational therapy: Influence of risk factors and demographics in a Pakistani population.","5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat various types of cancers. Although widely used, it has consistently been attributed to cardiotoxicities after administration. The purpose of this study was to assess the parameters and predictors of cardiotoxicities associated with various 5-FU-based chemotherapeutic protocols in patients with GI/colorectal cancer, as well as the correlation of these cardiotoxic events with age, sex, cumulative dose, and risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and family history of cardiac diseases. A prospective study consisting of 396 patients of both sexes was conducted in the oncology ward of Nishtar Hospital in Multan, Pakistan. Patients were grouped according to the therapeutic protocol they received (5-FU monotherapy or in combination, with different dosing regimens). Electrocardiography and serum troponin levels were used to assess 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. In cases where cardiotoxicity was detected, 5-FU treatment was interrupted; nitroglycerin, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers were administered; and cardiac monitoring was initiated. 5-FU was discontinued in all cases of acute myocardial infarction. Of the 396 patients, 28.5% reported different cardiotoxic symptoms after receiving various 5-FU-containing protocols. 35% had anginal pain, 13% suffered a myocardial infarction, 11% developed hypertension, and 10% presented heart failure. Patients receiving 5-FU combination therapy showed cardiotoxic events that were significantly different from those on 5-FU monotherapy. Based on the ECG results, only the QTc-d interval increased significantly (p < 0.001) after therapy. 68% of the patients had troponin levels > 2 ng/mL at the end of treatment. Pre-existing cardiac diseases, treatment duration, smoking, and obesity were found to be influential components in the development of cardiotoxicity, and patients with cancer should be closely monitored during 5-FU chemotherapy.","Hina Raza, Mariyam Javaid, Wajiha Rehman, Sana Rafiq, Zermina Rashid, Rahat Shamim, Abdolelah Jaradat, Mohamed Deifallah Yousif","Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners","2024Oct03",NA
"39360438","Association of metabolic score for visceral fat with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality: A prospective cohort study.","Our study aimed to evaluate the association between the metabolic score for visceral fat (METS-VF) and mortality. We conducted a cohort study comprising 11,120 participants. We employed weighted multivariable Cox regression analysis to assess the relationship between METS-VF and mortality. Restricted cubic spline analyses were used to investigate potential non-linear associations. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of METS-VF and other obesity-related indicators for mortality. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to confirm the robustness of the results. Mendelian randomization analysis was utilized to assess potential causality. Over a median follow-up duration of 83 months, a total of 1014 all-cause deaths, 301 cardiovascular deaths, and 262 cancer deaths occurred. For every 0.2-unit increase in METS-VF, the hazard ratios(HRs) of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality were 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.20], 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.31), and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.25), respectively. In addition, restricted cubic spline analyses revealed no significant non-linear associations between METS-VF and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models, hazard ratios of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality were higher in the highest METS-VF group compared to the reference group. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed that our results were robust. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that METS-VF predicted mortality better than other obesity-related indicators. Mendelian randomization analysis confirmed significant causal relationships. METS-VF was positively associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer mortality. These findings suggest that METS-VF could serve as a straightforward, reliable, and cost-effective marker for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality.","Shanshan Jia, Xingwei Huo, Xianghao Zuo, Liming Zhao, Lu Liu, Lirong Sun, Xiaoping Chen","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","2024Oct03",NA
"39360426","Sociodemographic and Clinical Predictors of Weight Gain During the First Year of Antiretroviral Therapy among Adults Living With HIV in Urban Tanzania.","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the survival of people living with HIV (PLHIV) but this success has been accompanied by an increase in noncommunicable diseases. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 4000 adult PLHIV who were initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to assess weight gain during the first year of treatment and associated sociodemographic and clinical factors. Anthropometric data were collected at ART initiation and monthly follow-up visits. The mean weight gain during the first year of treatment was 2.6 ± 0.3 kg, and the prevalence of overweight or obesity increased from 26.3% at baseline to 40.7%. Female sex, greater household wealth, lower CD4-T-cell counts, higher WHO HIV disease stage, and pulmonary tuberculosis were associated with a greater increase in body mass index (P < .05).

"39360277","Bidirectional association between perioperative skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat in colorectal cancer patients and their prognostic significance.","Low skeletal muscle mass and high adipose tissue coexist across the body weight spectrum and independently predict the survival ratio of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. This combination may lead to a mutually exacerbating vicious cycle. Tumor-associated metabolic conditions primarily affect subcutaneous adipose tissue, but the nature and direction of its relationship with skeletal muscle are unclear. This study aims to examine the bidirectional causal relationship between skeletal muscle index (SMI) and subcutaneous fat index (SFI) during the perioperative period in CRC patients; as well as to validate the association between perioperative SMI, SFI, and CRC prognosis. This population-based retrospective cohort study included patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer who underwent radical resection at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University between September 2012 and February 2019. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 1,448 patients were analyzed. Preoperative (P1), 2 months postoperative (P2), and 5 months postoperative (P3) CT scans were collected to evaluate the skeletal muscle index (SMI; muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra divided by height squared) and subcutaneous fat index (SFI; subcutaneous fat area at the third lumbar vertebra divided by height squared). A random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was used to examine the intra-individual relationship between SMI and SFI, and Cox regression was employed to assess the association between SMI, SFI, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). The median age at diagnosis was 59.00 years (IQR: 51.00-66.00), and 587 patients (40.54%) were female. RI-CLPM analysis revealed a negative correlation between SFI and subsequent SMI at the individual level: P1-P2 (β = -0.372, p = 0.038) and P2-P3 (β = -0.363, p = 0.001). SMI and SFI showed a negative correlation during P1-P2 (β = -0.363, p = 0.001) but a positive correlation during P2-P3 (β = 0.357, p = 0.006). No significant correlation was found between the random intercepts of SFI and SMI at the between-person level (r = 0.157, p = 0.603). The Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression model identified that patients with elevated SFI had poorer recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.55). Compared to patients with normal preoperative SMI and SFI, those with low SMI or high SFI had poorer recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03-1.55) and overall survival (HR, 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04-1.87). However, no significant association between SMI and SFI and the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients was observed postoperatively. In CRC patients, preoperative muscle loss leads to postoperative fat accumulation, exacerbating muscle loss in a feedback loop. Elevated preoperative SFI predicts poorer survival outcomes. Monitoring SMI and SFI is crucial as prognostic indicators, despite non-significant postoperative associations. Further research is needed to improve patient outcomes.","Guanghong Yan, Lizhu Liu, Mengmei Liu, Xinyue Jiang, Ping Chen, Min Li, Qingyan Ma, Yani Li, Sifan Duan, Ruimin You, Yanni Huang, Zhenhui Li, Dingyun You","Frontiers in nutrition","2024",NA
"39360276","The effect of cumulative exposure with unhealthy lifestyles on the H-type hypertension among Chinese adults: a community-based, propensity-score-matched, and case-control study.","To assess whether cumulative exposure of unhealthy lifestyles is associated with HTH in Chinese adults and to explore the combination of unhealthy lifestyles. This study combined a community-based cross-sectional study with a 1:1 matched case-control study using propensity scores among adults in six randomly selected districts from Hunan Province, China. We recruited 5,258 people, of whom 4,012 met the criteria. Lifestyles and personal characteristics were collected by a questionnaire. Lifestyle score was calculated using cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, inactive exercise, unhealthy diet and abnormal BMI. HTH was defined as having a diagnosis of essential hypertension with Hcy ≥ 15 umol/L. Logistic regression models and multivariate analyses were used to explore the associations. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and attributable risk proportion (ARP) for the association of HTH with lifestyle score. The dose-response relationship was evaluated using restricted cubic splines method. Of the 4,012 adults, 793 had HTH, with a population prevalence of 19.8%. In the propensity-score-matched case-control study, 1,228 (614 cases and 614 controls) were included, and those with at least four unhealthy lifestyle factors had a higher risk of HTH than those with 0 unhealthy lifestyle factor (adjusted OR = 2.60, 95%CI:1.42-4.78), with an ARP of the cumulative exposure of unhealthy lifestyle was 28.23% (95% CI: 6.34-37.86%). For three unhealthy lifestyles group, the combination of heavy alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and BMI ≥24 Kg/m2 was most associated with HTH (OR = 7.49, 95%CI: 1.12-50.08). For four unhealthy lifestyles group, the combination of smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and BMI ≥24 Kg/m2 had the greatest correlation with HTH (OR = 3.75, 95%CI: 1.24-7.38). Notably, there was a monotonically increasing curve (J-shaped) relationship between unhealthy lifestyles and the risk of HTH (p = 0.014). Our findings suggest that there was a significant cumulative exposure effect of unhealthy lifestyles on the risk of HTH, with the largest effect combination being heavy alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and BMI ≥24 Kg/m2. Targeted interventions that reducing heavy alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, and keep a normal BMI could substantially reduce the burden of HTH.","Ling Li, Jia Wang, Jing Li, Minqi Li, Tianyao Long, Yangyi Zhengliu, Yuan Lv, Xiuqin Hong","Frontiers in nutrition","2024",NA
"39360272","Plant-based diets-impacts of consumption of little or no animal-source foods on human health.","The world, in 2024, faces both climate and biodiversity crises, and the food system does contribute significantly to these crises. For some, the solution is simple - intakes of animal source foods (ASFs) should be considerably reduced, and consumption of plant-source foods (PSFs) should be greatly increased. Advocates for such a dietary transformation express confidence that plant-based diets will not only benefit planetary health, but will provide nutrient adequacy for all, and will also result in considerable protection from chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, as described in this perspective, the dramatic reductions in ASFs, entailed by many plant-based diets, will worsen already prevalent micronutrient and protein deficiencies. The protections provided by plant-based diets against NCDs appear to be more strongly associated with reduced intakes of calories and salt, and increased intakes of fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, rather than with reduced intakes of ASFs. Any possible absolute adverse effects of red and processed meat consumption on NCDs are very small and uncertain. Other ASFs either appear to have no impact on NCDs (poultry meat and eggs), or are associated with protections against obesity, cardiovascular events, brain disorders and some cancers (seafood and dairy). Rigorous randomized controlled trials of all newly proposed environmentally-protective plant-based diets are required, so as to provide clear-cut evidence of micronutrient and protein adequacy, with or without, supplementation, fortification and/or biofortification. In the meantime, dietary guidelines should advise moderating excessive consumption, rather than substantially limiting or excluding ASFs from the human diet.","Alice V Stanton","Frontiers in nutrition","2024",NA
"39360256","Cardiometabolic index is associated with increased bone mineral density: a population-based cross-sectional study.","Osteoporosis is a multifactorial bone disease in which lipid metabolism plays an important role. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is a critical indicator for diagnosing osteoporosis. The cardiometabolic index (CMI) is a novel metric that combines two quantitative indicators of blood lipids-triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). This study explores the association between CMI and BMD and seeks to elucidate the role of lipid metabolism in the context of bone health. Based on the data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-March 2020-pre-pandemic, weighted multiple linear regression and smooth curve fitting were used to study the relationship between CMI and femoral BMD. Stratified analyses were also conducted for age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, diabetes and hypertension status. And, the saturation threshold effect of CMI was further analyzed using a two-stage linear regression model. This study enrolled a total of 1,650 participants (48.7% males), with an average age of 63.0 ± 8.6 years. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, CMI was positively correlated with total femur BMD, trochanter BMD, and intertrochanter BMD, while the correlation with femur neck BMD was not statistically significant. In the fully adjusted model, each unit increase in CMI was associated with a 0.026 (g/cm2) increase in total femur BMD, a 0.022 (g/cm2) increase in trochanter BMD, and a 0.034 (g/cm2) increase in intertrochanter BMD. Subjects in the highest quartile of CMI had a 0.034 (g/cm2) increase in total femur BMD, a 0.035 (g/cm2) increase in trochanter BMD, and a 0.039 (g/cm2) increase in intertrochanter BMD in the fully-adjusted model compared to those in the lowest quartile. In addition, saturation was observed between CMI and total femur BMD, trochanter BMD and intertrochanter BMD, with saturation thresholds of 1.073, 1.431 and 1.073, respectively. CMI is strongly associated with BMD, indicating its potential relevance in bone metabolism. However, the role of CMI in the context of bone health, especially regarding osteoporosis risk, requires further investigation in large-scale prospective studies.","Xujin Wu, Xixin Jin, Wei Xu, Chang She, Liubing Li, Yongtao Mao","Frontiers in public health","2024","Humans; Bone Density; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutrition Surveys; Osteoporosis; Absorptiometry, Photon; Aged; Cholesterol, HDL; Triglycerides; Femur"

"39360170","Risk Factors in Serrated Pathway Lesions: N-Glycosylation Profile as a Potential Biomarker of Progression to Malignancy.","The serrated pathway contributes to interval colorectal cancers, highlighting the need for new biomarkers to assess lesion progression risk. The β1,6-GlcNAc branched N-glycans expression in CRC cells was associated with an invasive phenotype and with immune evasion. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential risk factors for progression of serrated lesions (SLs) to malignancy, analyzing the N-glycosylation profile of epithelial/infiltrating immune cells. A retrospective cohort study was performed with data from 53 colonoscopies (48 patients). Sixty-three serrated pathway lesions (SPLs) were characterized based on N-glycosylation profile (lectin histochemistry/flow cytometry) and MGAT5 expression. Statistical analysis was performed to search for associations between the glycoprofile and clinical variables from each patient. Increased β1,6-GlcNAc branched N-glycans expression in epithelial cells is found associated with age (p = 0.007 in SPL), smoking (p = 0.038 in SL), increased BMI (p = 0.036 in sessile serrated lesions [SSL]), and polyp dimensions ≥10 mm (p = 0.001 in SL), while increased expression of these structures on immune cells is associated with synchronous CA number (CD4+T cells: p = 0.016; CD8+T cells: p = 0.044 in SL) and female gender (p = 0.026 in SL). Moreover, a lower high-mannose N-glycans expression in immune cells is associated with smoking (p = 0.010 in SPL) and synchronous CA presence (p = 0.010 in SPL). Higher expression of these glycans is associated with female (p = 0.016 in SL) and male (p = 0.044 in SL) gender, left colon location (p = 0.028), dysplasia (p = 0.028), and adenocarcinoma (p = 0.010). We identified an association between an abnormal glycoprofile and several clinical risk factors, proposing the N-glycosylation profile as a potential biomarker of tumor progression in the serrated pathway. The N-glycosylation anatomopathological profile analysis could be further used to decide shorter interval follow-up in patients with SPL.","Henrique Fernandes-Mendes, Catarina M Azevedo, Mónica Garrido, Carolina Lemos, Isabel Pedroto, Salomé S Pinho, Ricardo Marcos-Pinto, Ângela Fernandes","GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology","2024Oct",NA
"39360092","Functional Outcome in Obese Patients Undergoing Image-Based Cruciate Retaining Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Using the Subvastus Approach: A Short-Term Study.","Introduction Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that significantly affects quality of life, especially among obese and morbidly obese individuals. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for end-stage OA, but it presents unique challenges in obese patients. The mini-subvastus approach (SA) and robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) are emerging techniques that may address these challenges. This study evaluates the clinical and radiological outcomes of cruciate-retaining (CR) RA-TKA using the mini-subvastus approach in obese and morbidly obese patients. Methods This study included 114 obese patients (215 knees) with primary OA who underwent CR RA-TKA (Maxx Meril CR knee, USA) using the Cuvis Joint® robotic system. Patients had a BMI of ≥30 kg/m² (n=101) and morbid obesity with a BMI ≥40 kg/m² (n=13). Preoperative planning involved CT scans and the J-planner for optimal implant size and positioning. Surgery was performed without tourniquets, and patients were mobilized postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the American Knee Society Score (AKSS) at three and six months. Results The study included 85 females and 29 males with an average age of 61.8 years. Satisfactory knee exposure was achieved in all cases using SA, with no major complications such as wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, or component misalignment. Intraoperative challenges were managed effectively, including two cases of medial collateral ligament avulsion and one partial patellar tendon avulsion. Postoperative VAS scores showed significant pain reduction from pre-op (6.54) to post-op day 3 (1.3). AKSS improved from a pre-op average of 33.9 to 70.7 at three months and 80.9 at six months. Most patients (80%) achieved exceptional range of motion (ROM) ≥120° at six months. Discussion The mini-subvastus approach in RA-TKA offers several advantages, including reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery, and improved quadriceps strength, even in obese patients. The use of robotic assistance ensures accurate component positioning and alignment, mitigating the challenges typically associated with obese patients undergoing TKA. Conclusion The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of CR RA-TKA using the mini-subvastus approach in obese and morbidly obese patients. This technique provides adequate exposure, reduces pain, and promotes early mobilization and recovery with satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes. The findings support the potential for wider adoption of this approach in managing knee OA in obese populations, though further studies with longer follow-up are warranted.","Sujoy K Bhattacharjee, Arghya Kundu Choudhury, Swapnil Priyadarshi, Avijeet Prasad, Akhil Ahlawat","Cureus","2024Sep",NA
"39360060","Evaluation and Risk Factor Analysis of Post-tonsillectomy Hemorrhage in an Adult Population: An Experience From a National Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) Center in Georgia.","Tonsillectomy, a common surgical procedure for removing the palatine tonsils, is frequently performed in the otorhinolaryngology department. Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, is considered a straightforward operation. However, serious complications, such as post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage, can complicate the recovery period. The research aims to analyze and estimate the factors associated with postoperative bleeding in the adult Georgian population. We conducted a cross-sectional study. The data was collected retrospectively from the medical records of adult patients aged 18 years and older, who underwent tonsillectomy in 2022 and 2023 at the National Center of Otorhinolaryngology, Japaridze-Kevanishvili Clinic, in Georgia. We performed univariate analysis using binary logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis and calculated odds ratio (OR) to identify factors associated with postoperative bleeding among patients with tonsillectomy. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 778 adult patients with tonsillectomy were included in the study. Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage occurred in 14.7% (n=114) of cases, with primary bleeding observed in 8.1% (n=63) of patients and secondary bleeding in 6.6% (n=51) of cases. The highest incidence of bleeding was observed on days 1 (8.1%, n=63) and 7 (1.3%, n=10). The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant association between post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage and several factors: smoking status (OR=10.1, 95% CI: 6.1-16.7, p<0.001) and having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 (OR=3.6, 95% CI: 2.1-6.1, p<0.001). The study confirmed several significant risk factors, including smoking and higher BMI, that are associated with an increased risk of bleeding among patients, undergoing tonsillectomy. Further research is needed to validate these findings in the Georgian population.","Nino Besiashvili, Irina G Datikashvili-David, Tatia Gakharia","Cureus","2024Sep",NA

Data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study of an annual health check-up population aged younger than 66 years were used to calculate the three IR surrogate indexes. The association with HTN-HUA and insulin resistance surrogates was examined with multinomial logistic regression and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A total of 6952 participants were included, including 671 (9.65%) participants with HTN alone, 272 (3.91%) participants with HUA alone, and 62 (0.90%) participants with HTN and HUA. Binary multiple-logistic regression results showed that TG/HDL-C was significantly correlated with HTN, HUA, and HTN-HUA. Compared with the lowest quartile, the odds ratios (95% CI) of the highest quartile of TG/HDL-C for HTN-HUA were 3.462 (1.138~10.530). TG/HDL-C and TyG-BMI had moderate discriminative abilities for HTN-HUA, and the area under the curve was 0.748 (0.682~0.815), 0.746 (0.694~0.798). Our study suggests that TG/HDL-C had a significant correlation with HTN-HUA and that TG/HDL-C had moderate discriminative abilities for HTN-HUA.","Yu-Qiang Zuo, Zhi-Hong Gao, Yu-Ling Yin, Xu Yang, Xing Guan, Ping-Yong Feng","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy","2024",NA

"39359768","Male breast cancer: a 32-year retrospective analysis in radiation therapy referral center in northern Iran.","Breast cancer commonly occurs in women, and male breast cancer makes up less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. The limited prevalence of male breast cancer has led to decreased attention being paid to this condition, resulting in its diagnosis occurring at later ages and at more severe disease stages. This study evaluates the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of male patients diagnosed with breast cancer who visited the northern region of Iran from 1992 to 2023. This descriptive study reviewed data from 58 cases of male breast cancer between 1992 and 2023. The study aimed to examine and describe the information connected to these patients. The data were analyzed with SPSS.22 set at P value less than 0.05. The mean age of the patients examined was 62.10±13.40 years, while their mean BMI was 27.08±4.95. The study found no statistically significant correlation between BMI with stage and kinds of recurrence, including metastasis and local recurrence (P>0.05). The right and left breast involvement rates were equal (48.28%) in 28 cases, and 2 cases (3.40%) had bilateral involvement. The bone was the predominant site of metastasis, accounting for 69.23% of cases. The analysis revealed no significant correlation between stage and metastasis (P=1.000) or local recurrence (P=0.543). Most metastasis and all the local recurrence were observed in stages 3 and 4. Male breast cancer mainly occurs in older age and is diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease.

"39359759","Prevalence, impact and associated factors of abnormal preoperative investigation result in patients undergoing surgery in Dilla University referral hospital: cross-sectional study.","As one domain of preoperative assessment, preoperative investigations are often ordered to evaluate patient's medical condition for risk stratification and assessing patient status to undergoing surgery. Despite the fact that laboratory testing can assist in ensuring the best possible preoperative condition, routine screening examinations have a number of drawbacks. Although there are evidence-based recommendations for which investigations should be done, the tradition of routine preoperative testing is still prevalent and clinical practice with abnormal results detected varies. Institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from 1 November to January at Dilla University Referral Hospital. Data was collected from complete pre-anaesthesia check-up sheets, investigations already done. It was collected at the individual level by using, closed-ended self-guided questionnaire. The collected data was entered, cleaned, edited and checked using SPSS version 26 for data processing and analysis. Logistic regression was performed to examine the impacts of abnormal preoperative investigation results and summarised by using tables and figures. An Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was computed to determine the level of significance. Data of 208 patients (65.9 female) with mean±standard deviation age 30.83±15.340 years and 22.59±2.99 BMI were analysed. Patients were mostly American Society of Anaesthesiologists I and II underwent National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence Grade 2 surgeries and surgical shape class 3. Totally, 178 (44.5%) test results were abnormal. CBC is the most detected abnormal result. Only 15 (3.75%) abnormalities had an impact in terms of delay, further investigations, and surgical technique. Comorbidity (AOR 7.982, 95% CI, P=0.041), medication history (AOR 1.463, 95% CI, P=0.013), ASA physical status II (AOR 3.287, 95% CI, P=0.029) and history of smoking (AOR 1.577, 95% CI, P=0.049) were factors which was significantly associated with abnormal preoperative investigation result.

"39359722","Differential lipid signaling from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contributes to type 1 diabetes development.","We reported that Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β)-derived lipids (iDLs) contribute to type 1 diabetes (T1D) onset. As CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are critical in promoting β-cell death, we tested the hypothesis that iDL signaling from these cells participates in T1D development. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from wild-type non-obese diabetic (NOD) and NOD.iPLA2β+/- (NOD.HET) mice were administered in different combinations to immunodeficient NOD.scid. In mice receiving only NOD T cells, T1D onset was rapid (5 weeks), incidence 100% by 20 weeks, and islets absent. In contrast, onset was delayed 1 week and incidence reduced 40%-50% in mice receiving combinations that included NOD.HET T cells. Consistently, islets from these non-diabetic mice were devoid of infiltrate and contained insulin-positive β-cells. Reduced iPLA2β led to decreased production of proinflammatory lipids from CD4+ T cells including prostaglandins and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), products of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), and inhibition of their signaling decreased (by 82%) IFNγ+CD4+ cells abundance. However, only DHETs production was reduced from CD8+ T cells and was accompanied by decreases in sEH and granzyme B. These findings suggest that differential select iDL signaling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contributes to T1D development, and that therapeutics targeting such signaling might be considered to counter T1D.","Tayleur D White, Abdulaziz Almutairi, Ying Gai-Tusing, Daniel J Stephenson, Benjamin D Stephenson, Charles E Chalfant, Xiaoyong Lei, Brian Lu, Bruce D Hammock, Teresa P DiLorenzo, Sasanka Ramanadham","Frontiers in immunology","2024","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Signal Transduction; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Group VI Phospholipases A2; Lipid Metabolism; Mice, SCID; Female"
"39359454","Residual kidney function and sleep quality in hemodialysis patients.","Sleep disorders frequently affect end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis. However, the relationship between sleep quality and residual kidney function is still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate this relationship. In this analytical cross-sectional study, 225 patients who were referred to dialysis centers were studied, and based on renal function, they were classified into two groups with and without residual kidney function. The study employed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire to evaluate sleep quality. Multiple linear regression was utilized to determine the factors affecting sleep quality with a significance level consideration at p<0.05. The mean age of patients was 58.23 ± 13.50 years. 58.7% of patients were males. The problem of serious and very serious sleep in the Sleep latency and sleep duration has been more than other components. 72% of hemodialysis patients had poor sleep quality. In the multiple linear regression model, age (β = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.096, 0.788), sex (β = -0.847, 95% CI: -1.641, -0.054), Body mass index (β = 0.153, 95% CI: 0.058, 0.249) and dialysis duration (β = 0.097, 95% CI: 0.002, 0.192) were independently and significantly associated with sleep quality score. However, there was no statistically significant relationship between sleep quality and residual kidney function. In conclusion, poor sleep quality is very common in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, sleep disorders in hemodialysis patients should be considered as one of the most challenging problems by healthcare providers, and early diagnosis and intervention are essential to improve sleep quality.","Elham Ramezanzade, Masoud Khosravi, Alireza Jafarinezhad, Sepideh Sadeghi Dehbane, Mirsaeed Attarchi","Caspian journal of internal medicine","2024Fall",NA

A comprehensive estimation of the prevalence of osteoporosis in provinces of Iran seems to be necessary. This study was a descriptive-analytical study. The study population included 518 people aged 30-65 years including 297 males and 221 females to measure their bone density. The data collection method was through BMD measurement using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) method. All obtained data stored in the SPSS-16 database and statistically analyzed. The data analyzed using analytical, statistical methods. The significance level of the test was considered to be P≤0.05. In the present study, according to BMI status, 45.2% of the patients were obese, 38.2% were overweight. Despite the general belief that increasing in weight can be associated with an increase in bone mass, the present research revealed that nearly 35.9% of the research population, suffered obesity and osteoporosis at the same time. Metargression analysis of data from different studies have illustrated that changing in frequency of osteoporosis as an oriented change in prevalence of osteoporosis from west to east and south to north (P≤0.05).

A total of 515 In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) patients undergoing subsequent cycles were included after applying exclusion criteria. They were divided into a control group of 362 patients and a study group of 153 patients who received oral L-carnitine until oocyte retrieval.140 patients were matched according to maternal age, infertility duration, body mass index (BMI), day three top-quality embryos rate, by propensity score matching (PSM). The study investigated the relationship between L-carnitine treatment and in vivo oocyte maturation, normal fertilization, and subsequent embryo development. Following PSM, initial differences in BMI and Day3 top-quality embryo rate between groups were nullified, we created two comparable cohorts with highly similar characteristics. In the subsequent cycles, the study group showed significant improvements in in vivo oocyte maturation rate at retrieval (p=0.002), normal in vitro fertilization rate (p=0.003), blastocyst formation rate (p=0.003), and usable blastocyst rate compared to controls. Although there was no significant difference in the top-quality embryo rate on Day 3, the study group showed a 10% increase in the upper quartile (55.35% vs. 66.67%). The cumulative clinical pregnancy and live birth rates showed a significant improvement (59.82% vs. 68.42%,p=0.004, 47.41% vs. 59.80%, p=0.002). Furthermore, self-control analysis revealed substantial enhancements (p<0.001) in all outcome measures following L-carnitine administration, resulting in the birth of 74 healthy neonates without congenital anomalies.

"39359416","Longitudinal associations between microRNAs and weight in the diabetes prevention program.","Circulating microRNAs show cross-sectional associations with overweight and obesity. Few studies provided data to differentiate between a snapshot perspective on these associations versus how microRNAs characterize prodromal risk from disease pathology and complications. This study assessed longitudinal relationships between circulating microRNAs and weight at multiple time-points in the Diabetes Prevention Program trial. A subset of participants (n=150) from the Diabetes Prevention Program were included. MicroRNAs were measured from banked plasma using a Fireplex Assay. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate relationships between microRNAs and changes in weight at baseline, year-1, and year-2. Logistic regression was used to evaluate whether microRNAs at baseline were associated with weight change after 2 years. In fully adjusted models that included relevant covariates, seven miRs (i.e., miR-126, miR-15a, miR-192, miR-23a, and miR-27a) were statistically associated with weight over 2 years. MiR-197 and miR-320a remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Baseline levels of let-7f, miR-17, and miR-320c were significantly associated with 3% weight loss after 2 years in fully adjusted models. This study provided evidence for longitudinal relationships between circulating microRNAs and weight. Because microRNAs characterize the combined effects of genetic determinants and responses to behavioral determinants, they may provide insights about the etiology of overweight and obesity in the context or risk for common, complex diseases. Additional studies are needed to validate the potential genes and biological pathways that might be targeted by these microRNA biomarkers and have mechanistic implications for weight loss and disease prevention.","Elena Flowers, Benjamin Stroebel, Kimberly A Lewis, Bradley E Aouizerat, Meghana Gadgil, Alka M Kanaya, Li Zhang, Xingyue Gong","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; MicroRNAs; Adult; Obesity; Biomarkers; Body Weight; Overweight; Circulating MicroRNA; Cross-Sectional Studies; Weight Loss"

This study explored the value of serum steroid profiling as a complementary biomarker for malignancy diagnosis of ACC other than diameter and explored the influence of sex and functional status. In this retrospective study, a matched cohort of patients diagnosed with either ACC or ACA based on histopathology was meticulously paired in a 1:1 ratio according to sex, age, and functional status. Eight serum steroids including 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and estradiol, were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We conducted a comparative analysis of the clinical characteristics and serum steroid profiles of patients with ACC and ACA, with further subgroup analysis. The study included 31 patients with ACC and 31 matched patients with ACA. Patients with ACC exhibited significantly larger tumor diameters, lower body mass index (BMI), and higher levels of 11-deoxycortisol, progesterone, and androstenedione than those with ACA. 11-deoxycortisol was the only valuable index for discriminating ACC from ACA, regardless of functional status and sex. Progesterone, DHEA, and DHEAS levels were higher in the functional ACC group than in the non-functional ACC group. Female ACC patients, especially in postmenopausal female exhibited higher levels of androstenedione than male patients. The area under the curve of tumor diameter, 11-deoxycortisol, and BMI was 0.947 (95% CI 0.889-1.000), with a sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 90.3%. Serum steroid profiling serves as a helpful discriminative marker for ACC and ACA, with 11-deoxycortisol being the most valuable marker.

A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 3558 OPFs patients hospitalized for surgical intervention between January 2017 and July 2022. The study obtained baseline values for various biomarkers and covariates, including fasting blood glucose, β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), triglycerides, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, drinking, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, aspartate aminotransferase, uric acid, the score of American society of anesthesiologists, homocysteine, parathyroid hormone, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A, magnesium, phosphorus and calcium. Multiple linear regression, curve fitting, threshold effects, and subgroup analyses were also applied. After adjusting for covariates in the regression analysis, the results revealed a negative correlation between β-CTX and P1NP levels and the baseline TyG index. Specifically, a one-unit increase in the TyG index was associated with a reduction in β-CTX levels of -0.06 (95% CI: -0.10, -0.01; P-value = 0.012) and a reduction in P1NP levels of -4.70 (95% CI: -9.30, -0.09; P-value = 0.046). Additionally, the inflection points for the nonlinear correlation between the TyG index and β-CTX and P1NP were found to be K = 6.31 and K = 6.63, respectively. The study demonstrated a negative, non-linear relationship among the TyG index, β-CTX and P1NP in OPFs patients hospitalized for surgical intervention.

We examined the global, regional, national, gender-based, age group-based, and temporal changes of early-onset CKD burden from 1990 to 2019, as well as proportional DALY attributions of various risk factors. From 1990 to 2019, the global age-specific incidence rate (per 100,000 population) significantly increased from 25.04 (95% confidence interval 18.51, 31.65) to 32.21 (23.73, 40.81) for early-onset CKD. However, the global age-specific death rate significantly decreased from 2.96 (2.76, 3.15) to 2.86 (2.61, 3.11), and the age-specific DALY rate remained stable. Regarding sociodemographic indexes (SDI), countries with middle SDI had the highest incidence rates and the fastest increasing trends, while those with low and low-middle SDI experienced the highest death and DALY rates. Women had a generally higher age-specific incidence rate than men, whereas men showed higher age-specific death and DALY rates. In addition, the burdens of CKD increased with age among adolescents and young adults. Moreover, the main attributable risk factors for DALY of early-onset CKD were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and body mass index (BMI). The age-specific incidence rate of early-onset CKD increased significantly from 1990 to 2019, and the age-specific DALY rate remained stable. High SBP, high FPG, and high BMI were the primary risk factors.

A retrospective study was conducted on a total of 944 knees diagnosed with osteoarthritis in 479 patients from January 2017 to December 2023. A scatterplot was used to describe the distribution of the CPAK classification, and the differences in lower limb alignment parameters and the CPAK classification were compared across genders (male, female), ages (middle-aged/<65 years, elderly/≥65 years), and BMI categories (normal/<25 kg/m2, overweight and obese/≥25 kg/m2) using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. The average arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle and joint line obliquity (JLO) were -3.03° ± 5.69° and 174.45° ± 4.29°, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of constitutional varus alignment in males and the overweight or obese group, while constitutional valgus alignment was more common in females and the normal BMI group (p < 0.05). Additionally, females had a greater apex distal JLO than males (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in lower limb alignment parameters among different age groups (p > 0.05). Although there were variations in alignment parameters across different genders and BMI categories in the knee osteoarthritis population, the predominant CPAK classifications were type I (38.03%), followed by type II (20.02%) and type IV (17.06%). The most common CPAK types were I, II, and IV, and they were not influenced by gender, BMI, or age, indicating that the CPAK classification can reliably reflect constitutional alignment. A better understanding of native alignment variability can aid in providing patient-specific recommendations when considering orthopedic alignment strategies.","Songlin Li, Xi Chen, Sen Liu, Hongjun Xu, Yang Yu, Shanni Li, Zhaojing Yin, Yiyang Du, Miaomiao Zhang, Peilai Liu, Wenwei Qian","Orthopaedic surgery","2024Oct02",NA

Incidence rates for T2DM were calculated and Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the association between ID and T2DM. Follow-up began from the 1 January 1977 (when T2DM data were available), participants' 22nd birthday or from the date the participants immigrated to Denmark, whichever came last and continued until the onset of T2DM, emigration, death or end of follow-up (31 December 2021), whichever came first. Persons with ID had more than double risk of T2DM compared with the reference group [aHR = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.09-2.20]. The strongest associations were found among women, persons born between 1980 and 1999 and among persons with mild ID. Persons with ID have an increased risk of T2DM. This knowledge is important in relation to the development and prioritising of preventive initiatives among persons with ID in the healthcare sector. Future research should focus on the underlying mechanisms that can explain the possible association between ID and T2DM as it allows a more targeted prevention strategy.","A Thorsted, S F Lehn, A Kofoed-Enevoldsen, A Andersen, A Heltberg, S I Michelsen, L C Thygesen","Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR","2024Oct02",NA
"39358993","Genetic analysis of selection bias in a natural experiment: Investigating in-utero famine effects on elevated body mass index in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study.","Natural-experiment designs that compare survivors of in-utero famine exposure to unaffected controls suggest that in-utero undernutrition predisposes to development of obesity. However, birth rates drop dramatically during famines. Selection bias could arise if factors that contribute to obesity also protect fertility and/or fetal survival under famine conditions. We investigated this hypothesis using genetic analysis of a famine-exposed birth cohort. We genotyped participants in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study (DHWFS, N=950; 45% male), of whom 51% were exposed to the 1944-1945 Dutch Famine during gestation and 49% were their unexposed same-sex siblings or ""time controls"" born before or after the famine in the same hospitals. We computed body-mass index (BMI) polygenic indices (PGIs) in DHWFS participants and compared BMI PGIs between famine-exposed and control groups. Participants with higher polygenic risk had higher BMIs (Pearson r=0.42, p<0.001). However, differences between BMI PGIs of famine-exposed participants and controls were small and not statistically different from zero across specifications (Cohen's d=0.10, p>0.092). Our findings did not indicate selection bias, supporting the validity of the natural-experiment design within DHWFS. In summary, our study outlines a novel approach to explore the presence of selection bias in famine and other natural experiment studies.","Jiayi Zhou, Claire E Indik, Thomas B Kuipers, Chihua Li, Michel G Nivard, Calen P Ryan, Elliot M Tucker-Drob, M Jazmin Taeubert, Shuang Wang, Tian Wang, Dalton Conley, Bastiaan T Heijmans, Lambert H Lumey, Daniel W Belsky","American journal of epidemiology","2024Oct02",NA

This retrospective study was conducted on data of adult individuals, free of cancer at baseline, from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between January 2009 and February 2023. The patients with HF were categorized as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The primary outcome was incident cancer, including obesity-related, tobacco-related, lung, colorectal and breast cancers. Of 33 033 individuals enrolled, 16 722 were diagnosed with HF, including 10 086 (60.3%) with HFpEF and 6636 (39.7%) with HFrEF. During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years (inter-quartile range: 2.6-7.3), incident cancer was diagnosed in 10.5% (1707 patients) of the non-HF group and 15.1% (2533 individuals) of the HF group. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, patients with HF had a 58% increased risk of cancer than those without HF [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48-1.69, P < 0.001]. This risk was consistent across genders (female: adjusted HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.74-2.18, P < 0.001; male: adjusted HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.30-1.54, P < 0.001) and HF phenotypes (HFpEF: adjusted HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.57-1.81, P < 0.001; HFrEF: adjusted HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.20-1.46, P < 0.001).

"39358834","Overview of the therapeutic efficacy of marine fish oil in managing obesity and associated metabolic disorders.","In the present scenario, obesity is a challenging health problem and its prevalence along with comorbidities are on the rise around the world. Ingestion of fish becomes trendy in daily meals. Recent research has shown that marine fish oil (FO) (found in tuna, sardines, and mackerel) may offer an alternative method for reducing obesity and problems associated with it. Marine FO rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) and long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-6 PUFA) plays an important role in reducing abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome and has a variety of disease-fighting properties, including cardioprotective activity, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory activity. Studies in rodents and humans have indicated that LC n-3 PUFA potentially elicit a number of effects which might be useful for reducing obesity, including suppression of appetite, improvements in circulation, enhanced fat oxidation, energy expenditure, and reduced fat deposition. This review discusses the interplay between inflammation and obesity, and their subsequent regulation via the beneficial role of marine FO, suggesting an alternative dietary strategy to ameliorate obesity and obesity-associated chronic diseases.","Riya Kar, Titli Panchali, Pipika Das, Ananya Dutta, Manisha Phoujdar, Shrabani Pradhan","Physiological reports","2024Oct","Humans; Animals; Fish Oils; Obesity; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Metabolic Diseases"

We hypothesised that elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines increase neuroinflammation and exacerbate depressive symptoms. The participants were part of a cohort study for whom data was available for both 2015 and 2019. In 2015, blood samples were collected from 232 participants. Their depressive symptoms were assessed both 2015 and 2019 using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (n = 33). The multiplex immunoassay system (Luminex® 200) was used to measure the serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A and TNFα. Data were analysed using linear models with the level of significance considered to be p < 0.05. After controlling for age, BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption, in 2015 the serum concentrations of IL-17A and TNFα in 2015 were significantly positively associated with the CES-D scores of women (standardised β (B) = .027, p < 0.01 and B = 0.26, p < 0.01, respectively).

"39358769","Effect of body mass index on ovarian reserve and ART outcomes in infertile women: a large retrospective study.","Obesity poses a significant global health challenge, with profound implications for women's reproductive health. The relationship between ovarian reserve and body mass index (BMI) remains a subject of debate. While obesity is generally associated with poorer outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART), the evidence remains inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-pregnancy BMI on ovarian reserve and ART outcomes in infertile patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures at Tongji Hospital between 2016 and 2023. The study included 30,746 initial fresh cycles and 5,721 singleton deliveries. Patients were stratified by age and further categorized into four BMI groups: lean (< 18.5 kg/m²), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m²), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m²), and obese (≥ 30.0 kg/m²). The primary endpoints of the study were pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. To explore the association between BMI and these outcomes, we adjusted for relevant confounding factors and utilized multivariate linear regression models, complemented by multifactorial logistic regression analyses. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly lower in the overweight and obese groups compared to the normal weight group. After adjusting for age, a negative correlation was found between AMH and BMI in the age subgroups of 20-30 and 30-35 years. Among women aged 20-35 years, those in the overweight and obese groups had significantly fewer retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, and two-pronuclear (2PN) embryos than their normal weight counterparts. Despite these differences, pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese groups were comparable to those in the normal weight group across all age categories. Additionally, obesity was linked to an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and macrosomia. An age-related decrease in AMH levels was evident with increasing BMI. Although being overweight or obese is associated with poorer embryo and perinatal outcomes, it does not seem to have a substantial impact on fertility.","Yuan-Li Li, En-Qi Yan, Guang-Nian Zhao, Lei Jin, Bing-Xin Ma","Journal of ovarian research","2024Oct02","Humans; Female; Body Mass Index; Ovarian Reserve; Retrospective Studies; Adult; Infertility, Female; Pregnancy; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Anti-Mullerian Hormone; Obesity; Fertilization in Vitro; Pregnancy Rate; Pregnancy Outcome; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic"

Approximately 23.6 million deaths due to CVD is expected in the year 2030 worldwide. The CVD burden is more severe in developing countries, including Tanzania. This study analyzed the spatial-temporal trends and determinants of cardiovascular diseases in Tanzania from 2010 to 2019. Individual data were extracted from Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI), Mbeya Zonal Referral Hospital (MZRH), Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) and Bugando hospitals and the geographical data from TMA. The model containing spatial and temporal components was analyzed using the Bayesian hierarchical method implemented using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). The results found that the incidence of CVD increased from 2010 to 2014 and decreased from 2015 to 2019. The southern highlands, lake, central and coastal zones were more likely to have CVD problems than others. It was also revealed that people aged 60-64 years OR = 1.49, females OR = 1.51, smokers OR = 1.76, alcohol drinkers OR = 1.48, and overweight OR = 1.89 were more likely to have CVD problems. Additionally, a 1oC increase in the average annual air maximum temperature was related to a 14% risk of developing CVD problems. The study revealed that the model, which included spatial and temporal random effects, was the best-predicting model. The study shows a decreased CVD incidence rate from 2015 to 2019. The CVD incidences occurred more in Tanzania's coastal and lake areas between 2010 and 2019.

With rapidly rising rates of obesity, there is particular interest in how obesogenic diets influence tissue homeostasis and risk of tumorigenesis; epidemiologically, these diets have a positive correlation with various cancers, including colorectal cancer. The gastrointestinal tract is a highly specialized, continuously renewing tissue with a fundamental role in nutrient uptake and is, in turn, influenced by diet composition and host metabolic state. Intestinal stem cells are found at the base of the intestinal crypt and can generate all mature lineages that comprise the intestinal epithelium and are uniquely influenced by host diet, metabolic by-products and energy dynamics. Similarly, tumour growth and metabolism can also be shaped by nutrient availability and host diet. In this Review, we discuss how different diets and metabolic changes influence intestinal stem cells in homeostatic and pathological conditions, as well as tumorigenesis. We also discuss how dietary changes and composition affect the intestinal epithelium and its surrounding microenvironment.","Jessica E S Shay, Ömer H Yilmaz","Nature reviews.

Among 26,953 individuals with incident HTN, 613 (2.3%) met criteria for RH after 4.7 months (interquartile range, 1.2-11.3). Variables selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and its missing indicator (a dummy variable created if baseline SBP is absent), use of antihypertensive medication at the time of cohort entry, body mass index, and atherosclerosis risk. The random forest technique achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.893 (95% CI, 0.881-0.904) and the best calibration with a calibration slope of 1.01. Complete case analysis is not a valuable option (AUC = 0.625).

To further investigate this, spinal kinematics during various activities of daily living (i.e., walking, running, lifting, and stair climbing) of 49 patients with chronic LBP and a group of 51 sex-, age-, and BMI-matched healthy controls were used to calculate lumbar spine movement variability which was quantified using different indices (i.e., coefficient of variation, coupling angle variability in vector coding, deviation phase of the continuous relative phase and an angle-angular velocity variability). General and task-specific pain-related fear was assessed using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and the Photograph Series of Daily Activities-Short Electronic Version, respectively. Linear regression analyses showed no significant association between movement variability and pain-related fear, however, the sample consisted of younger individuals with moderate disability and with low levels of pain and pain-related fear. In addition, the different variability indices were weakly correlated and varied greatly depending on the method used and the task performed. Therefore, comparisons between studies with different movement variability calculation methods or different activities should be treated with caution.","Corinne Kehl, Magdalena Suter, Embla Johannesdottir, Monika Dörig, Christian Bangerter, Michael L Meier, Stefan Schmid","Scientific reports","2024Oct02","Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Activities of Daily Living; Female; Fear; Adult; Middle Aged; Lumbar Vertebrae; Chronic Pain; Movement; Case-Control Studies; Biomechanical Phenomena; Lumbosacral Region"

PATZ1 is expressed in human and mouse adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) and adipocytes. In cellular models, PATZ1 promotes adipogenesis via protein-protein interactions and DNA binding. PATZ1 ablation in mouse adipocytes and APCs leads to a reduced APC pool, decreased fat mass, and hypertrophied adipocytes. ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq analyses show that PATZ1 supports adipogenesis by interacting with transcriptional machinery at the promoter regions of key early adipogenic factors.

We performed a posthoc pooled analysis of data from 10 prospective, randomised trials involving serial coronary intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) (n=5,823). The percent atheroma volume (PAV) was calculated as the proportion of the entire vessel wall occupied by atherosclerotic plaque. Mean overall age was 58±9 years (28% women). In a fully adjusted multivariable analysis (following adjustment of sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure [SBP], smoking, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol, triglyceride levels, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, trial, region, and baseline PAV), an increase in age by one standard deviation was linked with PAV progression (β-estimate 0.097; 95% confidence interval 0.048-0.15; p<0.001). In patients with good risk factor control (LDL-cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L and SBP <130 mmHg), increasing age remained associated with PAV progression (0.123; 0.014-0.23; p=0.027).

No significant differences were observed in patient-reported outcome measures, operative time, or complication rates between obese and nonobese patients undergoing FELD. The mean operative time was longer in the endoscopic group compared with the open surgery group (70.2 vs 59.8 minutes), but the hospital stay was significantly shorter for endoscopic patients (1.7 vs 2.4 nights, P = 0.0006). Both obese and nonobese groups showed significant improvements in visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the final follow-up, with satisfaction rates of 85.7% in the endoscopic group reporting good to excellent outcomes. FELD is a viable and effective alternative to traditional open surgery for obese patients, offering comparable clinical outcomes and the added benefit of a shorter hospital stay. These findings suggest that obesity does not inherently affect surgical outcomes, underscoring the need for further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods. FELD offers a viable and effective surgical option for obese patients, with outcomes comparable to traditional surgery but with the added benefit of shorter hospital stays.","Xavier Castel, Henri d'Astorg, Mohammad Allaji, Vincent Fiere, Marc Szadkowski","International journal of spine surgery","2024Oct02",NA
"39357983","Cohort profile: Understanding the influence of early life environments and health and social service system contacts over time and across generations through the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (WAACHS) Linked Data Study.","Despite the volume of accumulating knowledge from prospective Aboriginal cohort studies, longitudinal data describing developmental trajectories in health and well-being is limited. The linkage of child and carer cohorts from a historical cross-sectional survey with longitudinal health-service and social-service administrative data has created a unique and powerful data resource that underpins the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (WAACHS) linked data study. This study aims to provide evidence-based information to Aboriginal communities across Western Australia, governments and non-government agencies on the heterogeneous life trajectories of Aboriginal children and families. This study comprises data from a historical cross-sectional household study of 5289 Aboriginal children from the WAACHS (2000-2002) alongside their primary (N=2113) and other (N=1040) carers, and other householders. WAACHS data were linked with Western Australia (WA) government administrative datasets up to 2020 including health, education, child protection, police and justice system contacts. The study also includes two non-Aboriginal cohorts from WA, linked with the same administrative data sources allowing comparisons of outcomes across cohorts in addition to between-group comparisons within the Aboriginal population. Linked data coverage rates are presented for all WAACHS participants. Child health outcomes for the WAACHS children (Cohort 1) are described from birth into adulthood along with other outcomes including child protection and juvenile justice involvement. Analysis of data from both the child and carer cohorts will seek to understand the contribution of individual, family (intergenerational) and community-level influences on Aboriginal children's developmental and health pathways, identify key developmental transitions or turning points where interventions may be most effective in improving outcomes, and compare service pathways for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. All research is guided by Aboriginal governance processes and study outputs will be produced with Aboriginal leadership to guide culturally appropriate policy and practice for improving health, education and social outcomes.","Francis Mitrou, Helen Milroy, Juli Coffin, Sharynne L Hamilton, Christopher G Brennan-Jones, Stefanie Schurer, Elizabeth A Davis, Peter Richmond, Hayley M Passmore, Glenn Pearson, Alex Brown, Melissa O'Donnell, Asha C Bowen, Peter Azzopardi, Katherine M Conigrave, Jenny Downs, Matthew M Cooper, Kathryn A Ramsey, Anna Ferrante, Sarah E Johnson, Leah Cave, Philip Vlaskovsky, Katrina D Hopkins, Heather A D'Antoine, Ted Wilkes, Stephen R Zubrick","BMJ open","2024Oct02","Humans; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Western Australia; Child; Female; Child, Preschool; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Child Health; Adolescent; Infant; Health Surveys; Cohort Studies"

Less is known about how health in the two countries compares in mid-life, a time of emerging health decline, including inequalities in health. We compare measures of current regular smoking status, obesity, self-rated health, cholesterol, blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin using population-weighted modified Poisson regression in the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) in Britain (N = 9665) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) in the USA (N = 12 300), when cohort members were aged 34-46 and 33-43, respectively. We test whether associations vary by early- and mid-life socioeconomic position. US adults had higher levels of obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Prevalence of poor self-rated health and current regular smoking was worse in Britain. We found smaller socioeconomic inequalities in mid-life health in Britain compared with the USA. For some outcomes (e.g. smoking), the most socioeconomically advantaged group in the USA was healthier than the equivalent group in Britain. For other outcomes (hypertension and cholesterol), the most advantaged US group fared equal to or worse than the most disadvantaged groups in Britain. US adults have worse cardiometabolic health than British counterparts, even in early mid-life. The smaller socioeconomic inequalities and better overall health in Britain may reflect differences in access to health care, welfare systems or other environmental risk factors.","Charis Bridger Staatz, Iliya Gutin, Andrea Tilstra, Laura Gimeno, Bettina Moltrecht, Dario Moreno-Agostino, Vanessa Moulton, Martina K Narayanan, Jennifer B Dowd, Lauren Gaydosh, George B Ploubidis","International journal of epidemiology","2024Aug14","Humans; United Kingdom; United States; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Smoking; Obesity; Health Status Disparities; Hypertension; Socioeconomic Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Blood Pressure; Cholesterol; Health Status; Glycated Hemoglobin; Cohort Studies"

In 2013, PFAS contamination was discovered in Veneto (Italy), leading to the implementation of a Surveillance Program (SP). Our objective is to investigate the association between PFAS exposure and biomarkers of liver function using single-pollutant and mixture approaches, while exploring the sex-specific differences and the mediating role of obesity in the association. The study included 42,094 subjects aged ≥20 years participating in the SP. We used generalized additive models to investigate the association between several PFAS and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, adjusting for possible confounders and stratifying by sex. Results were back-transformed to show predicted percentage changes in outcomes per ln-unit increase in PFAS levels; furthermore, we explored the role of BMI in the abovementioned causal pathway, considering it as a potential confounder or mediator PFAS joint effect was investigated using Quantile G-computation. One ln-unit increase in PFHxS concentrations was associated with a 1.49% (95%CI: 0.87, 2.12) and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.27, 1.40) increase in ALT levels, in males and females respectively; one ln-unit increase in PFOA concentrations was associated with a 1.03% (95%CI: 0.50, 1.55) increase in ALT levels in males, and a 0.52% (95% CI: 0.22, 0.82) and a 0.60% (95% CI: 0.25, 0.96) increase in AST levels in females and males. PFOS showed no association with ALT and AST levels. Quantile G-computation revealed that an interquartile increase in the PFAS mixture was associated with a 3.02% increase (95% CI: 1.65, 4.43) and a 1.65% (95% CI: 0.77, 2.5) increase in ALT levels, in females and males. Mediation analysis suggested that BMI suppressed the association between PFAS and ALT levels, with positive direct effects higher than the total effects. Our findings suggest sex-specific associations between PFAS exposure and liver function biomarkers and underscore the need for additional studies on potential mediators.","Isabella Rosato, Erich Batzella, Gisella Pitter, Francesca Russo, Filippo Da Re, Tony Fletcher, Cristina Canova","Environmental research","2024Sep30",NA
"39357583","Simiao Wan attenuates high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia in mice by modulating the gut microbiota-bile acid axis.","Hyperlipidemia is a lipid metabolism disorder and a risk factor for obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. It occurs mostly in the old adults; however, its incidence rate is increasing annually and there is a trend towards younger adults. Current clinical drugs for treating hyperlipidemia have multiple side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop safe and effective drugs from natural products to prevent and treat hyperlipidemia. Simiao Wan (SMW) is a classic Chinese medicine prescription first recorded in the Cheng Fang Bian Du of the Qing Dynasty. Studies have shown that SMW has excellent efficacy in metabolic diseases, which can effectively improve hyperlipidemia combined with other metabolic diseases. However, its underlying mechanism in hyperlipidemia treatment is yet to be clarified. To investigate the hypolipidemic effect of SMW on hyperlipidemic mice and explore whether the gut microbiota-bile acid (BA) axis is the potential mechanism. A hyperlipidemic mouse model was established using a high-fat diet (HFD), and the hypolipidemic effect of SMW was detected in vivo. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and BA metabolism analysis to explore the hypolipidemic mechanisms of SMW. Western blotting was conducted to detect the expression of proteins involved in the gut microbiota-bile acid axis to determine the potential lipid-lowering pathway. Excessive obesity in hyperlipidemic mice was alleviated after 8 weeks of SMW treatment. The total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased. SMW also reduced hepatic lipid and inguinal white adipose tissue accumulation in HFD-induced hyperlipidemic mice. Furthermore, intestinal bile saline hydrolase (BSH) level, associated with BA excretion, decreased. Meanwhile, SMW decreased the abundance of BSH-enriched microbes in hyperlipidemic mice. SMW increased the intestinal conjugated-BAs contents in hyperlipidemic mice, especially tauro-β-muricholic acid and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid, which are ileac farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonists. Inhibited intestinal FXR signaling with SMW was accompanied by a decreased expression of intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 and the activation of hepatic FXR, which promoted hepatic cholesterol conversion to BA. SMW indirectly attenuated HFD-induced hyperlipidemia in mice by regulating the gut microbiota-BA axis. Our results provide a pharmacological basis for SMW treating hyperlipidemia and suggest a new idea for developing lipid-lowering drugs.","Kexin Wang, Wenjie Xu, Wen He, Mengze Ding, Ting Xia, Xiaomei Tan","Journal of ethnopharmacology","2024Sep30",NA
"39357546","Inhibition of ATGL alleviates MASH via impaired PPARα signalling that favours hydrophilic bile acid composition in mice.","Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is an attractive therapeutic target in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This study investigated the effects of pharmacological ATGL inhibition on the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and fibrosis in mice. Streptozotocin-injected male mice were fed an HFD to induce MASH. Mice receiving the ATGL inhibitor, Atglistatin (ATGLi), were compared to controls using liver histology, lipidomics, metabolomics, 16s rRNA, and RNA sequencing. Human ileal organoids, HepG2 cells, and Caco2 cells treated with the human ATGL inhibitor NG-497, HepG2 ATGL knockdown cells, gel-shift, and luciferase assays were analysed for mechanistic insights. We validated its benefits on steatohepatitis and fibrosis in a low-methionine choline-deficient mouse model. ATGLi improved serum liver enzymes, hepatic lipid content, and histological liver injury. Mechanistically, ATGLi attenuated PPARα signalling, favouring hydrophilic bile acid (BA) synthesis with increased Cyp7a1, Cyp27a1, Cyp2c70, and reduced Cyp8b1 expression. Additionally, reduced intestinal Cd36 and Abca1, along with increased Abcg5 expression, were consistent with reduced levels of hepatic TAG-species containing PUFAs like linoleic acids as well as reduced cholesterol levels in the liver and plasma. Similar changes in gene expression associated with PPARα signaling and intestinal lipid transport were observed in ileal organoids treated with NG-497. Furthermore, HepG2 ATGL knockdown cells revealed reduced expression of PPARα target genes and upregulation of genes involved in hydrophilic BA synthesis, consistent with reduced PPARα binding and luciferase activity in the presence of the ATGL inhibitors. Inhibition of ATGL attenuates PPARα signalling, translating into hydrophilic BAs, interfering with dietary lipid absorption, and improving metabolic disturbances. The validation with NG-497 opens a new therapeutic perspective for MASLD. The global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a crucial public health concern. Since adherence to behavioural interventions is limited, pharmacological strategies are necessary, as highlighted by the recent FDA approval of resmetirom. However, since our current mechanistic understanding and pathophysiology-oriented therapeutic options for MASLD are still limited, novel mechanistic insights are urgently needed. Our present work uncovers that pharmacological inhibition of ATGL, the key enzyme in lipid hydrolysis using Atglistatin (ATGLi), improves metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, and associated key features of metabolic dysfunction in a mouse model of MASH and MCD-induced liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that attenuation of PPARα signalling in the liver and gut favours hydrophilic bile acid composition, ultimately interfering with dietary lipid absorption. One of the drawbacks of ATGLi is its lack of efficacy against human ATGL, thus limiting its clinical applicability. Against this backdrop, we could show that ATGL inhibition using the human inhibitor NG-497 in human primary ileum-derived organoids, Caco2 cells, and HepG2 cells translated into therapeutic mechanisms similar to ATGLi. Collectively, these findings open a new avenue for MASLD treatment development by inhibiting human ATGL activity.","Emmanuel Dauda Dixon, Thierry Claudel, Alexander Daniel Nardo, Alessandra Riva, Claudia Fuchs, Veronika Mlitz, Georg Busslinger, Hubert Schnarnagl, Tatjana Stojakovic, Joana Senéca, Helga Hinteregger, Gernot F Grabner, Dagmar Kratky, Henkjan Verkade, Robert Zimmermann, Guenter Haemmerle, Michael Trauner","Journal of hepatology","2024Sep30",NA

This study explores the potential utility of family history, together with present and past comorbidities, in identifying distinct etiopathogenic subgroups. This approach may facilitate more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and personalized therapy. We performed a multiple correspondence analysis on patients' comorbidities, followed by hierarchical principal component clustering of clinical data from 48 healthy volunteers and 327 patients with at least one of 19 selected AIDs included in the TRANSIMMUNOM cross-sectional study. We identified three distinct clusters characterized by: 1) the absence of comorbidities, 2) polyautoimmunity, and 3) polyinflammation. These clusters were further distinguished by specific comorbidities and biological parameters. Autoantibodies, allergies, and viral infections characterized the polyautoimmunity cluster, while older age, BMI, depression, cancer, hypertension, periodontal disease, and dyslipidemia characterized the polyinflammation cluster. Rheumatoid arthritis patients were distributed across all three clusters. They had higher DAS28 and prevalence of extra-articular manifestations when belonging to the polyinflammation and polyautoimmunity clusters, and also lower ACPA and RF seropositivity and higher pain scores within the polyinflammation cluster. We developed a model allowing to classify AID patients into comorbidity clusters. In this study, we have uncovered three distinct comorbidity profiles among AID patients. These profiles suggest the presence of distinct etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying these subgroups.

Dietary and nutrient intake were assessed at baseline and follow-up using a food frequency questionnaire and the Korean Food Consumption Table. Food items were categorized into overall PDI, healthy PDI (hPDI), and unhealthy PDI (uPDI), with MASLD defined using the fatty liver index. Baseline characteristics and food intake groups were evaluated based on PDI quintiles and stratified by sex. Further analyses involved stratification by age, body mass index, alcohol intake, and physical activity in men and women. Over a median follow-up period of 4.2 y, MASLD occurred in 1532 participants.

"39357338","Oct-B: A derivative of L-BAIBA significantly alleviating high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice.","The rising prevalence of obesity is a global health concern. Supplementation with (S)-β-aminoisobutyric acid (L-BAIBA) has shown potential in preventing obesity and related metabolic disorders induced by high-fat diets. However, developing effective and low-toxicity BAIBA derivatives remains a challenging yet promising field. In this study, we introduce Oct-B, a novel BAIBA ester compound, which exhibits 80-fold greater efficacy than L-BAIBA in alleviating obesity in high-fat diet-fed mice. Our results demonstrate that Oct-B significantly reduces serum TG, TC, LDL-C, and the activities of ALT and AST, and also reduces TG and TC in liver, surpassing the effects of L-BAIBA. Histological analysis shows that Oct-B significantly decreases lipid accumulation in liver tissues, normalizes mast cells in white adipose tissue, and upregulates the expression of UCP1 protein in white adipose tissue. The qRT-PCR results indicated Oct-B alleviates obesity by downregulating lipogenic genes (PPARγ, ACC1, FAS), upregulating lipolysis related genes (PPARα, HSL) and thermogenic gene UCP1. Additionally, quantitative mass spectrometry reveals a marked increase in L-BAIBA levels in white fat, brown fat, serum, and muscle following Oct-B administration. These findings suggest that Oct-B is an efficient L-BAIBA substitute, offering a promising therapeutic approach for preventing and treating high-fat diet-induced obesity.","Jianhua Wang, Shanshan Wei, Jinxiu Guo, Xin Xie, Wenxue Sun, Shiyuan Zhao, Junjun Meng, Fang Wang, Jing Wang, Rong Rong, Pei Jiang","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","2024Sep25",NA

However, there is lack of recent data on xerophthalmia, especially among school-aged children in Malaysia. We hypothesized that xerophthalmia persists among rural schoolchildren in Malaysia and potentially associated with socio-demographic status and malnutrition. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 596 schoolchildren (8-12 years) from ten rural primary schools located in five states across Malaysia. Children meeting the criteria for xerophthalmia assessment included those diagnosed with vitamin A deficiency (VAD) (plasma retinol < 0.70 µmol/L) and marginal VAD (plasma retinol 0.70 to < 1.05 µmol/L). The overall prevalence of xerophthalmia was 48.8%, with the most common ocular sign being conjunctival xerosis (38.9%). The occurrence of xerophthalmia was negatively associated with retinol-binding protein 4 (RPB4) (P=0.003), alpha-carotene (P=0.04), hemoglobin (P=0.004), weight (P=0.02), body mass index (BMI) (P=0.04) and WAZ (weight-for-age z-score) (P=0.04) status.

Additionally, the study sought to identify potential risk factors associated with the presence or severity of neuropathic pain and to investigate its impact on clinical disease activity assessment. We conducted a cross-sectional study at two tertiary rheumatology centers, enrolling patients diagnosed with SpA. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and current therapies were collected. Neuropathic pain was assessed using the PainDETECT Questionnaire (PD-Q) and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI). Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, t-tests, and Pearson's correlations to evaluate the relationships between neuropathic pain scores and clinical disease activity indices. The study included 177 patients. Of these, 22.2% had a PD-Q score ≥19, showing a high likelihood of neuropathic pain, while 64.9% scored ≤12, suggesting the absence of significant neuropathic components. The mean PD-Q score was 11.5 ± 10.1. Subgroup analyses showed that females had significantly higher scores for paroxysmal and evoked pain (p < 0.05), and obese patients had significantly higher scores across all NPSI subscores (p < 0.05). Moderate positive correlations were found between neuropathic pain scores and clinical disease activity indices, such as DAPSA (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001) and ASDAS-CRP (r = 0.42, p < 0.01).

"39357127","Gastric cancer-Epidemiology, modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, challenges and opportunities: An updated review.","Gastric cancer represents a significant global health challenge due to its high mortality and incidence rates, particularly in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. This comprehensive review synthesizes the latest epidemiological data and explores both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated with gastric cancer, aiming to delineate the multifactorial etiology of this disease. Modifiable risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, obesity, dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, whereas nonmodifiable factors comprise genetic predispositions, age, family history and male gender. The interplay of these factors significantly impacts the risk and progression of gastric cancer, suggesting potential preventive strategies. The challenges in treating gastric cancer are considerable, largely because of the late-stage diagnosis and the heterogeneity of the disease, which complicate effective treatment regimens. Current treatment strategies involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. The FLOT regimen (5-FU, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel) is now a standard for resectable cases in Europe and the US, showing superior survival and response rates over ECF and ECX regimens. For HER2-positive gastric cancer, trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy improves overall survival, as demonstrated by the ToGA trial. Additionally, immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab and nivolumab offer promising results. However, the five-year survival rate remains low, underscoring the urgency for improved therapeutic approaches. Recent advancements in molecular biology and cancer genomics have begun to pave the way for personalized medicine in gastric cancer care, focusing on molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapy. This review also highlights the critical need for better screening methods that could facilitate early detection and treatment, potentially improving the prognosis. By integrating epidemiological insights with new therapeutic strategies, this article aims to thoroughly understand of gastric cancer's dynamics and outline a framework for future research and clinical management, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach to tackle this formidable disease.","Tajul Islam Mamun, Sabrina Younus, Md Hashibur Rahman","Cancer treatment and research communications","2024Sep24",NA

This cross-sectional study used baseline data of 150,506 adult participants of the Lifelines study. To quantify obesogenicity of Dutch neighbourhoods, the Obesogenic Built Environment CharacterisTics (OBCT) index was used, calculated for 1000 m circular buffers around participant's residencies. Z-scores of components across food and physical activity (PA) environments were averaged, and rescaled from 0 to 100. Weight status was operationalised as objectively measured waist circumference. Stratified linear regression analyses by (self-reported) sociodemographic factors, perceived stress, impulsivity, self-discipline, and deliberation were conducted when interaction terms were significant (P < .01). Mediation by adherence to the Dutch PA guidelines and dietary behaviour was examined using the difference-in-coefficients approach. Every 10% increase in OBCT index was associated with a 0.65 (P < .001, 95%CI [0.59, 0.71]) centimetre larger waist circumference. The association was largest for respondents who were younger, had the lowest income, the highest educational level, the least self-discipline, the highest impulsivity scores and the most perceived stress. Adherence to PA guidelines and dietary behaviour mediated 13.3% of this association; however, the difference in coefficients was not statistically significant. Our findings enable to better target lifestyle interventions to individuals most vulnerable to obesogenic environments.

"39357088","The effect of active vitamin D supplementation on body weight and composition: A meta-analysis of individual participant data.","Obesity is associated with vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. However, previous studies showed mixed effects of VitD (25-hydroxyVitD/calcidiol) supplementation on body weight. The biological actions of VitD require the hydroxylation of inactive VitD into active VitD (1.25-dihydroxyVitD/calcitriol). This step is highly regulated; therefore, supplementing with inactive VitD might not be sufficient to overcome the potential adverse health effects of VitD deficiency. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of data acquired from randomised placebo-controlled calcitriol trials (RCTs) to determine the effects of calcitriol on body weight and weight-related parameters. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases up to January 27, 2024, and excluded those involving dialysis or cancer patients. We obtained IPD from eligible trials and assessed bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool and methodological quality using the Heyland Methodological Quality Score. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017076202). Although none of the studies reported information regarding our primary objective, we obtained IPD for 411 patients, with 206 randomised to receive calcitriol and 205 to placebo. This dataset enabled us to conduct an IPD meta-analysis with 17,084 person-months of follow-up (median: 11 months). Meta-analysis showed that calcitriol does not alter body weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass or lean body mass compared to placebo. Adjusting for age and sex did not alter the outcomes. In conclusion, this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis indicate that calcitriol does not affect body weight in normal-weight postmenopausal women and lean patients with type 1 diabetes nor in people suffering from obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Whether calcitriol lowers body weight in VitD-sufficient people with obesity remains to be elucidated.","Sabrina M Oussaada, Isis Akkermans, Sandeep Chohan, Jacqueline Limpens, Jos W R Twisk, Christiane Winkler, Janaka Karalliedde, J Christopher Gallagher, Johannes A Romijn, Mireille J Serlie, Kasper W Ter Horst","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","2024Sep21",NA
"39357086","Dietary eggs, egg nutrients, polygenic score for body mass index, ""Western pattern"" diet, and weight change, a prospective analysis in the Women's health initiative.","Eggs contain nutrients which could help enrich the diets of postmenopausal women. Egg consumption and elevated body weight have been associated with elevated risk of serious chronic disease. It is possible that elevated body weight mediates between egg consumption and serious chronic disease. However, few studies exist on the link between egg consumption and body weight in post-menopausal women, and none of them accounted for genetic weight gain predispositions. Our objective was to examine associations between egg consumption, body weight, and genetic predisposition for an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI), in postmenopausal women. We analyzed data from 4439 healthy Women's Health Initiative participants of European descent during a 6-year follow up using multivariable generalized linear mixed models to prospectively evaluate egg and egg-nutrient intake (measured by a food frequency questionnaire) against body weight and a BMI polygenic score (PGS-BMI) derived from GWAS meta-analysis effect-allele frequencies. We found a positive prospective association between change in egg intake and body weight during the 6-year follow up. For instance, at year 3, women whose intake had increased by 2.0 eggs/week had gained 0.70 kg (95%CI: 0.34, 1.07, p = 0.0002) more than women whose intake had decreased by 2.4 eggs/week, p-linear <0.0001. Cholesterol-intake and choline-intake, but not betaine-intake, showed similar significant associations. Exploratory analysis revealed that: 1) women only demonstrated these significant associations if they exhibited higher intakes of ""Western-pattern"" foods including processed and red meats, French fries, sweets and deserts, sugar-sweetened beverages, fried foods, and dietary fat, and dietary energy; and 2) there was a significant positive prospective association between PGS-BMI and body-weight change, but only in the top quintile of egg-intake change. We found significant positive prospective associations between weight change and changes in egg intake, cholesterol intake, and choline intake among healthy postmenopausal women of European ancestry in the Women's Health Initiative. Exploratory analyses revealed that: 1) these significant associations only obtained among women who ate large amounts of ""Western-pattern"" foods; and 2) women with a higher genetic susceptibility for an elevated BMI gained more weight only if they increased their egg intake considerably.

"39357059","Analysis of the Factors Affecting the Male-Female Sex Ratio of Babies Born through Assisted Reproductive Technology.","Until now, the sex ratio in a population is believed to be relatively stable with no male/female preponderance. There has been an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that assisted conception may significantly impact on sex ratio (SR). Several factors have been suggested to affect SR such as parental variables (paternal race, maternal age, and body mass index-(BMI), methods of fertilisation (in-vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection), stage of embryo transfer (cleavage/blastocyst), type of IVF cycle (fresh/cryopreserved), medications used for controlled ovarian stimulation, poor sperm motility, and even culture media. This study aims to investigate the potential impact of the different ART procedures on sex ratio. It will also explore the relationship between paternal race, maternal age and body mass index BMI on sex ratio. A retrospective cohort study from January 2017 to December 2023. Participants were women who had successful ART and delivery at Ninewells Assisted Conception Unit (NACU) Dundee and ART centre of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Overall, 294 (66.2%) of the case records and 150 (33.8%) were evaluated from NACU and LUTH respectively. More male infants 244 (66.8%) were delivered following pregnancies conceived with blastocyst embryo stage transfer when compared with female infants which stood at 121 (33.2%). Concerning cleavage embryo stage transfer, 56 (70.9%) were in favour of female newborns while males accounted for 23 (29.1%). The study revealed that there is an increase in the proportion of male babies born following certain assisted conception techniques such as blastocyst stage embryo transfer and IVF while more female babies were born when cleavage stage embryos were transferred or when ICSI was used as a method of fertilisation.","A O Ugwu, C C Makwe, V Kay","West African journal of medicine","2024Jul30","Humans; Female; Sex Ratio; Male; Retrospective Studies; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Adult; Pregnancy; Embryo Transfer; Fertilization in Vitro; Infant, Newborn; Nigeria; Maternal Age; Body Mass Index; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic"

It's linked to various chronic health issues and most often remains undiagnosed in developing nations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among adults attending general health check-ups at a tertiary care hospital. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among adult patients visiting for general health checkups in a tertiary care centre. The patients' data from 16 April 2023 to 24 November 2023 was retrieved from the hospital record. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by using the chemiluminescence micro particles immunoassay technique and classified as deficient, insufficient, and sufficient with values <20 ng/ml, 20-29 ng/ml, and 30-100 ng/ml, respectively. A convenience sampling method was used. The point estimate was calculated at a 95% Confidence Interval. Out of 357 adult patients, 291 (81.51%; 95% CI: 77.49%-85.54%) Confidence Interval) had hypovitaminosis D. Among them 124 (42.61%) were categorised as vitamin D insufficient and 167 (57.39%) as deficient. The mean age of patients was 43.25±12.99 years, with 205 (70.45%) female and 86 (29.55%) male. A total of 169 (58.08%) individuals were classified as obese. Dyslipidemia was observed in 249 (85.57%) patients, with 94 (32.30%) exhibiting hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was higher than other studies done in similar settings. This higher prevalence necessitates public awareness of vitamin D's importance, urging proactive screening and management by physicians and implementation of cost-effective guidelines by policymakers.","Sanjeeb Tiwari, Saroj Gc, Vijay Shrees, Sujata Maharjan, Aakash Sherpali, Khagendra Bhandari, Suman Oli","JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association","2024May31","Humans; Vitamin D Deficiency; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Female; Adult; Tertiary Care Centers; Nepal; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Vitamin D; Young Adult"

This study examined the factors associated with smoking, overweight/obesity, and hypertension among Nepalese women of reproductive age (15-49 years). This study used the Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS) 2016 (6,079 women for smoking and overweight/obesity, 6076 for hypertension) and 2022 (6,957 women for overweight/obesity and smoking status and 3,749 women for hypertension) for comparison of trends of NCD risk factors among women aged 15-49 years. Additionally, for each participant, risk factors score (range of 0 to 3) was created by summing individual risk factors. We assessed the determinants of risk factor clustering using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust sandwich variance estimator to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios using NDHS 2022. The national prevalence of overweight/obesity increased from 22.2% in 2016 to 29.2% in 2022 among women of reproductive age. In 2022, the prevalence for smoking, overweight/obesity, and hypertension were 3.8%, 29.2%, and 9.6%, respectively. More than one in four women (28.7%) had one NCD risk factor, while 6.5% had two such risk factors. Higher aged women (40-49 years) were more likely to have multiple NCD risk factors than those aged 15-29 years (APR: 3.19; 95% CI: 2.68-3.80). Those in the richest wealth quintile (APR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.24-1.85), as well as married (APR: 3.02; 95% CI: 2.43-3.76) and widowed/divorced (APR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.14-3.80) were more likely to have multiple NCD risk factors. Women from Koshi province (APR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.41-2.15) had more NCD risk factors than those from the Sudurpaschim province. Working women also had a higher prevalence of NCD risk factors compared to non-working women (APR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.06-1.43). Additionally, Hill Janajatis (APR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.21-1.72) and Dalits (APR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.15-1.75) women were more likely to have NCD risk factors compared to women of Brahmin hill origin. Clustering of two or more NCD risk factors was higher among women aged ≥30 years, those who are currently married or widowed/divorced/separated, working women, and individuals from the wealthiest socioeconomic groups. A higher burden of risk factors underscores the importance of targeted public health interventions, particularly among women from advantaged socio-economic groups, those of affluent regions, and in the workplace.","Barun Kumar Singh, Shiva Raj Mishra, Resham B Khatri","PloS one","2024","Humans; Female; Adult; Nepal; Adolescent; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Hypertension; Obesity; Smoking; Prevalence; Overweight; Cluster Analysis; Noncommunicable Diseases; Health Surveys"

We tested whether the association between obesity and its adverse consequences is reduced in regions in which obesity is prevalent and whether lower weight bias in high-obese regions can account for this reduction. Studies 1 and 2 used data from the United States (N = 2,846,132 adults across 2,546 counties) and United Kingdom (N = 180,615 adults across 380 districts) that assessed obesity's adverse consequences in diverse domains: close relationships, economic outcomes, and health. Both studies revealed that the association between obesity and its adverse consequences is reduced (or absent) in high-obese regions. Study 3 used another large-scale data set (N = 409,837 across 2,928 U.S. counties) and revealed that lower weight bias in high-obese regions seems to account for (i.e., mediate) the reduction in obesity's adverse consequences.

Identification of risk factors for TF could inform empiric treatment decisions and reduce suboptimal outcomes. To evaluate the incidence of TF to empirically prescribed oral antibiotics and identify risk factors for TF in females with uUTI in the United States (US). This retrospective cohort study used Optum's de-identified Electronic Health Record dataset (January 2017-September 2022). Eligible female patients aged ≥ 12 years had ≥ 1 diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in an outpatient ambulatory/emergency department (ED) setting, ≥ 1 empiric oral antibiotic prescription, and no evidence of complicated UTI (cUTI). TF was defined as having a new/repeat oral antibiotic prescription, IV antibiotic administration or acute UTI diagnosis ≤ 28 days following initial empiric oral antibiotic prescription​. Risk factors of TF were selected using LASSO and reported using adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CIs. Of 376,004 patients with uUTI, 62,873 (16.7%) experienced TF. Incidence of TF was highest in patients with history of antibiotic TF (33.9%) or fosfomycin prescription (30.1%). Significant risk factors of TF included ≥ 3 prior antibiotic prescriptions (aRR [95% CI]: 1.60 [1.56-1.64]); fosfomycin prescription (1.60 [1.38-1.86]); uUTI diagnosis in ED (1.49 [1.46-1.52]), Southern US residence (1.37 [1.35-1.40]), age ≥ 75 years (1.35 [1.29-1.41]), recurrent UTI (1.12 [1.10-1.14]) and obesity (1.06 [1.04-1.08]). Incidence of TF to empirically prescribed oral antibiotics for uUTI is considerable. Prior infections requiring antibiotic prescription and location of care are key risk factors for TF in female outpatients with uUTI. Knowledge of these TF risk factors can inform shared-decision making and supplement existing guidance on uUTI treatment.","Debra L Fromer, Meghan E Luck, Wendy Y Cheng, Malena Mahendran, Wilson L da Costa, Megan Pinaire, Mei Sheng Duh, Madison T Preib, Jeffrey J Ellis","Journal of general internal medicine","2024Oct02",NA

A prospective study was conducted with 388 participants undergoing pulmonary function test (PFT) and inspiratory-expiratory chest CT scans. The clinical data and HRCT assessments of SAD patients defined by both methods were compared. A prediction model for SAD was constructed based on logistic regression. SAD was defined in 122 individuals by spirometry and 158 by PRM. In HRCT visual assessment, emphysema, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening have higher incidence in SAD defined by each method. (p < 0.001). Quantitative CT showed that spirometry-SAD had thicker airway walls (p < 0.001), smaller lumens (p = 0.011), fewer bronchi (p < 0.001), while PRM-SAD had slender blood vessels. Predictive factors for spirometry-SAD were age, male gender, the volume percentage of emphysema in PRM (PRMEmph), tree-in-bud sign, bronchial wall thickening, bronchial count; for PRM-SAD were age, male gender, BMI, tree-in-bud sign, emphysema, the percentage of blood vessel volume with a cross-sectional area less than 1 mm2 (BV1/TBV). The area under curve (AUC) values for the fitted predictive models were 0.855 and 0.808 respectively. Compared with PRM, SAD defined by spirometry is more closely related to airway morphology, while PRM is sensitive to early pulmonary dysfunction but may be interfered by pulmonary vessels. Models combining patient information and HRCT assessment have good predictive value for SAD. HRCT reveals lung structural differences in small airway dysfunction defined by spirometry and parametric response mapping. This insight aids in understanding methodological differences and developing radiological tools for small airways that align with pathophysiology. Spirometry-SAD shows thickened airway walls, narrowed lumen, and reduced branch count, which are closely related to airway morphology. PRM shows good sensitivity to early pulmonary dysfunction, although its assessment of SAD based on gas trapping may be affected by the density of pulmonary vessels and other lung structures. Combining patient information and HRCT features, the fitted model has good predictive performance for SAD defined by both spirometry and PRM (AUC values are 0.855 and 0.808, respectively).","Bin Chen, Pan Gao, Yuling Yang, Zongjing Ma, Yingli Sun, Jinjuan Lu, Lin Qi, Ming Li","Insights into imaging","2024Oct02",NA

A retrospective cohort study of a prospectively maintained database of adult patients who underwent IGB insertion between July 2020 and November 2021 in a single private clinic in Kuwait. The patient either received the Elipse™ or Orbera365™ balloon and was followed until the end of treatment. A total of 358 patients were included, of which 265 and 93 each received the Elipse and Orbera365 balloons, respectively. The mean age of patients was 32.8 (SD 9), the mean body mass index (BMI) was 35 kg/m2 (SD 4.8), and 72.1% of patients were female. In the Elipse group, 254 patients completed treatment, and 84 patients completed the treatment with Orbera365. Weight loss outcomes were measured at the end of treatment: 4 months after Elipse insertion, and 12 months after Orbera365 insertion. Interim 4 months weight loss outcomes were also measured for the Orbera365 balloon. Patients in the Orbera365 group had significantly better total body weight loss (%TBWL, 14.7 kg [SD 8.9]) compared to the Elipse group (%TBWL 10 kg, [SD 5.6], p ≤ 0.0001) at the end of treatment, while there was no difference in weight loss outcomes between the two balloons at 4 months. There were more complications requiring premature balloon removal in the Orbera365 group (9.7%) compared to the Elipse group (3.4%). IGBs provide significant weight loss with an acceptable safety profile. The Orbera365 ballon shows better weight loss outcomes compared to the Elipse, likely due to longer duration of treatment. However, there was a higher rate of complications requiring premature balloon removal in the Orbera365 group. Studies with larger patient cohort is needed to verify the findings of this study.","Mohsen Alhashemi, Ahmed Alkhamis, Mohammad Jamal, Husain Almahmeed, Fatima Hamshari, Carol Dsouza, Sara Al-Hassani, Ahmed Almousawi, Wafaa Qasem","Obesity surgery","2024Oct02",NA

The objective of this study was to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and comprehensively identify its associated factors in Moroccan COPD patients. A cross-sectional, randomized study was carried out in the city of Fes, Morocco, as part of the large multicenter Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Study on people with COPD. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire containing sociodemographic, clinical, and quality-of-life data. The diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometry, and quality of life was measured by the Short Form Survey (SF-12) questionnaire. Using multiple linear regression, we assessed the relationship between several sociodemographic and clinical factors and SF-12 mental and physical quality-of-life scores. A total of 107 patients were included, with a male predominance (63.6%) and the most common age category being 60 years and older (51.4%). Additionally, 46.7% of participants were classified as Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1. The mean SF-12 mental component score was 41.32±9.18, and the mean SF-12 physical component score was 41.91±11.93. Multivariate analysis revealed that a greater mental HRQoL was associated with the male gender, a body mass index of 25 or higher, and GOLD stage 1, while a greater physical HRQoL was associated with the male gender, an age less than 60 years, absence of respiratory comorbidities, and GOLD stage 1. Our results show low scores of the mental and physical components of HRQoL in COPD patients in Morocco, suggesting the implementation of measures to reduce first the prevalence of the disease and then adopt an appropriate COPD management strategy to improve those people's quality of life.","Moncef Maiouak, Vanessa Garcia-Larsen, Soumaya Benmaamar, Ibtissam El Harch, Mohamed El Biaz, Chakib Nejjari, Mohammed Chakib Benjelloun, Karima El Rhazi","Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace","2024Oct02",NA
"39356095","Advanced lung cancer inflammation index is associated with mortality in critically ill patients with heart failure.","Nutrition and inflammation status play a vital role in the prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF). This study aimed to investigate the association between the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), a novel composite indicator of inflammation and nutrition, and short-term mortality among critically ill patients with HF. This retrospective study included 548 critically ill patients with HF from the MIMIC-IV database. ALI was computed using body mass index, serum albumin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality, and the secondary endpoint was 90 day mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis with long-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to assess the relationship between baseline ALI and short-term mortality risk. The incremental predictive ability of ALI was evaluated by C-statistic, continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The average age of 548 patients was 72.2 (61.9, 82.1) years, with 60% being male. Sixty-three patients (11.5%) died in the hospital, and 114 patients (20.8%) died within 90 days of intensive care unit admission. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the cumulative incidences of both in-hospital and 90 day mortality were significantly higher in patients with lower ALI (log-rank test, in-hospital mortality: P < 0.001; 90 day mortality: P < 0.001). The adjusted Cox proportional hazard model revealed that ALI was inversely associated with both in-hospital and 90 day mortality after adjusting for confounders [hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) (CI): 0.97 (0.94, 0.99), P = 0.035; HR (95% CI): 0.62 (0.39, 0.99), P = 0.046]. A linear relationship was observed between ALI and in-hospital mortality (P for non-linearity = 0.211). The addition of ALI significantly improved the prognostic ability of GWTG-HF score in the in-hospital mortality [C-statistic improved from 0.62 to 0.68, P = 0.001; continuous NRI (95% CI): 0.44 (0.20, 0.67), P < 0.001; IDI (95% CI): 0.03 (0.01, 0.04), P < 0.001] and 90 day mortality [C-statistic improved from 0.63 to 0.70, P < 0.001; continuous NRI (95% CI): 0.31 (0.11, 0.50), P = 0.002; IDI (95% CI): 0.01 (0.00, 0.02), P = 0.034]. Subgroup analysis revealed stronger correlations between ALI and in-hospital mortality in males and patients aged over 65 years (interaction P = 0.031 and 0.010, respectively). The C-statistic of in-hospital mortality in patients over 65 years was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.74). ALI at baseline can independently predict the risk of short-term mortality in critically ill patients with HF, with lower ALI significantly associated with higher mortality.

Post hoc analysis of data from patients (aged 1 month to <17 years) with ≥6 months of BRV treatment in a long-term, open-label trial (N01266 [NCT01364597]). Outcomes included body weight and body mass index (BMI) over time (z-score growth curves), and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Previous/ongoing medical conditions that may affect body weight (gastrointestinal and metabolic/nutritional disorders); concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs) were also evaluated. Two hundred nine patients (mean [standard deviation] age 7.9 [4.6] years) were analyzed. Most (154 [73.7%]) had focal-onset seizures. At study initiation, median (range) BRV dose was 1.0 (0.4-7.5) mg/kg/day. Overall, 189 (90.4%) patients had a previous or ongoing medical condition (gastrointestinal disorders: 43 [20.6%]; metabolism/nutritional disorders: 26 [12.4%]). Most patients followed z-score curves for body weight and BMI during BRV treatment, although there were outliers in both directions. Incidences of appetite/weight-change TEAEs were low. Twenty-three (11.0%) patients had a TEAE of decreased appetite and 14 (6.7%) had a TEAE of weight decreased. Long-term adjunctive BRV was well tolerated in growing children with no indication of detrimental effects on body weight. Brivaracetam is an antiseizure medication (ASM) used to treat seizures in people with epilepsy. Some ASMs can lead to changes in people's appetite and weight. Knowing the effect a drug has on appetite and weight is particularly important in children. We looked at 209 children with epilepsy taking brivaracetam and studied changes in their body weight and body mass index over time. The number of reported side effects related to appetite or weight change was low. There was no apparent long-term effect on their body weight, even when taking their medical history and use of other ASMs into account.","Florin I Floricel, Paula E Reichel, Najla Dickson, Sofia Fleyshman, Christoph Reichel, Jan-Peer Elshoff","Epilepsia open","2024Oct02",NA

To characterize independent body composition measures, we aimed to reduce easily-obtainable individual measures reflecting adiposity, anthropometrics and energy expenditure into fewer independent constructs, and to assess their potential sex- and age-specific relation with cardiometabolic diseases. Analyses were performed within European ancestry participants from UK Biobank (N = 418,963, mean age 58.0 years, 56% women). Principal components (PC) analyses were used for the dimension reduction of 11 measures of adiposity, anthropometrics and energy expenditure. PCs were studied in relation to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses, adjusted for confounding factors, were performed in all and stratified by age. Genome-wide association studies were performed in half of the cohort (N = 156,295) to identify genetic variants as instrumental variables. Genetic risk score analyses were performed in the other half of the cohort stratified by age of disease onset (N = 156,295). We identified two PCs, of which PC1 reflected lower overall adiposity (negatively correlated with all adiposity aspects) and PC2 reflected more central adiposity (mainly correlated with higher waist-hip ratio, but with lower total body fat) and increased height, collectively capturing 87.8% of the total variance. Similar to that observed in the multivariable-adjusted regression analyses, we found associations between the PC1 genetic risk score and lower risks of CAD and T2D [CAD cases <50 years, odds ratio: 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87, 0.94) per SD; T2D cases <50 years, odds ratio: 0.76 (0.72, 0.81)], which attenuated with higher age (p-values 8.13E-4 and 2.41E-6, respectively). No associations were found for PC2. The consistently observed weaker associations of the composite traits with cardiometabolic disease suggests the need for age-specific cardiometabolic disease prevention strategies.","Fleur L Meulmeester, Ko Willems van Dijk, Diana van Heemst, Raymond Noordam","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","2024Oct02",NA
"39355873","Roles of X-box binding protein 1 in liver pathogenesis.","The prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and viral liver infections presents significant challenges in modern healthcare and contributes to considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Concurrently, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has emerged as a major public health concern, reflecting the increasing rates of obesity and leading to more severe complications such as fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a distinct transcription factor with a basic-region leucine zipper structure, whose activity is regulated by alternative splicing in response to disruptions in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. XBP1 interacts with a key signaling component of the highly conserved UPR and is critical in determining cell fate when responding to ER stress in liver diseases. This review aims to elucidate the emerging roles and molecular mechanisms of XBP1 in liver pathogenesis, focusing on its involvement in DILI, viral liver infections, MAFLD, fibrosis/cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Understanding the multifaceted functions of XBP1 in these liver diseases offers insights into potential therapeutic strategies to restore ER homeostasis and mitigate liver damage.","Jihoon Tak, Yun Seok Kim, Sang Geon Kim","Clinical and molecular hepatology","2024Oct02",NA

Fallopian tube abnormalities were the most common cause of infertility, with tube blockage affecting nearly half of the participants. Additionally, this study revealed that prior pelvic surgery significantly increased the risk of infertility.","Eiman Kamal, Maisa Elzaki","The Pan African medical journal","2024","Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hysterosalpingography; Infertility, Female; Sudan; Adult; Prospective Studies; Fallopian Tube Diseases; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Incidence; Prevalence; Fallopian Tubes; Body Mass Index"
"39355616","The inverse associations between composite-dietary-antioxidant-index and sarcopenia risk in US adults.","It remains unknown whether composite-dietary-antioxidant-index (CDAI) is associated with the risk of sarcopenia. This study investigated the association of CDAI with sarcopenia risk among general US adults. A total of 10,093 participants were enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 6 survey cycles (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016 and 2017-2018). Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to examine the relationship between CDAI and the risk of sarcopenia. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to analyze nonlinear relationships. In a multi-variable logistic regression model adjusting for demographics, lifestyle, economic status and other dietary factors, higher CDAI score was related to a lower risk of sarcopenia among US adults. Compared the highest quartile of CDAI score with the lowest, the OR and 95%CI were 0.49 (0.31-0.75). Furthermore, the RCS demonstrated a linear dose-response relationship between CDAI and sarcopenia (P non-linearity=0.92). These results remained consistent across subgroups stratified by age, sex, physical activity, drinking status, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, energy intake, and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score. In addition, the favorable associations of CDAI were primarily attributed to Vitamin E intake. A higher CDAI score was associated with a lower risk of sarcopenia. According to these results, a greater adherence to CDAI may benefit sarcopenia prevention in adults.","Kang Wang, Qin Zhou, Zhongbiao Jiang, Shiping Liu, Hanfen Tang","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Female; Male; Sarcopenia; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; United States; Antioxidants; Adult; Aged; Diet; Risk Factors; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies"
"39355598","Potential Mechanisms of Epicardial Adipose Tissue Influencing Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.","Heart failure (HF) is the predominant terminal stage and the leading cause of mortality in cardiac disease. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects roughly 50% of HF patients globally. Due to the global aging population, the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of HFpEF have gradually increased. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), as a key visceral adipose tissue around the heart, affects cardiac diastolic function and exercise reserve capacity. EAT closely adheres to the myocardium and can produce inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters, and other factors through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, affecting the heart function by inflammatory response, cardiac metabolism and energy supply, cardiomyocyte structure and electrical activity, and pericardial vascular function. Currently, research on the mechanism and treatment methods of HFpEF is constantly improving. EAT may play a multi-level impact on the occurrence and development of HFpEF. This review also summarizes the potential impact of EAT on the heart in HFpEF combined with other metabolism-related diseases such as obesity or diabetes over other obesity-related measures, such as body mass index (BMI) or other adipose tissue. Above all, this review comprehensively summarizes the potential mechanisms by which EAT may affect HFpEF. The objective is to enhance our comprehension and management of HFpEF. Future research should delve into the mechanistic relationship between EAT and HFpEF, and investigate interventions aimed at EAT to improve the prognosis of patients with HFpEF.","Qiuxuan Li, Ur Rehman Muhib, Xiaoteng Ma, Zaiqiang Liu, Fei Gao, Zhijian Wang","Reviews in cardiovascular medicine","2024Sep",NA
"39355538","Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Unveiling Maternal Health Dynamics from Pregnancy Through Postpartum Perspectives.","Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent pregnancy-related medical issue and presents significant risks to both maternal and foetal health, requiring monitoring and management during pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM has surged globally in recent years, mirroring the rise in diabetes and obesity rates. Estimated to affect from 5% to 25% of pregnancies, GDM impacts approximately 21 million live births annually, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). However, consensus on diagnostic approaches remains elusive, with varying recommendations from international organizations, which makes the comparison between research complicated. Compounding concerns are the short-term and long-term complications stemming from GDM for mothers and offspring. Maternal outcomes include heightened cardiovascular risks and a notable 70% risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) within a decade postpartum. Despite this, research into the metabolic profiles associated with a previous GDM predisposing women to T2D remains limited. While genetic biomarkers have been identified, indicating the multifaceted nature of GDM involving hormonal changes, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin secretion, there remains a dearth of exploration into the enduring health implications for both mothers and their children. Furthermore, offspring born to mothers with GDM have been shown to face an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome during childhood and adolescence, with studies indicating a heightened risk ranging from 20% to 50%. This comprehensive review aims to critically assess the current landscape of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) research, focusing on its prevalence, diagnostic challenges, and health impacts on mothers and offspring. By examining state-of-the-art knowledge and identifying key knowledge gaps in the scientific literature, this review aims to highlight the multifaceted factors that have hindered a deeper understanding of GDM and its long-term consequences. Ultimately, this scholarly exploration seeks to promote further investigation into this critical area, improving health outcomes for mothers and their children.","Marina Mora-Ortiz, Lorenzo Rivas-García","Open research Europe","2024",NA
"39355507","Protein posttranslational modifications in metabolic diseases: basic concepts and targeted therapies.","Metabolism-related diseases, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, are becoming increasingly prevalent, thereby posing significant threats to human health and longevity. Proteins, as the primary mediators of biological activities, undergo various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, and SUMOylation, among others, which substantially diversify their functions. These modifications are crucial in the physiological and pathological processes associated with metabolic disorders. Despite advancements in the field, there remains a deficiency in contemporary summaries addressing how these modifications influence processes of metabolic disease. This review aims to systematically elucidate the mechanisms through which PTM of proteins impact the progression of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, the limitations of the current body of research are critically assessed. Leveraging PTMs of proteins provides novel insights and therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders. Numerous drugs designed to target these modifications are currently in preclinical or clinical trials. This review also provides a comprehensive summary. By elucidating the intricate interplay between PTMs and metabolic pathways, this study advances understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic dysfunction, thereby facilitating the development of more precise and effective disease management strategies.","Yunuo Yang, Jiaxuan Wu, Wenjun Zhou, Guang Ji, Yanqi Dang","MedComm","2024Oct",NA

This study analyzes patterns in obesity-related deaths from 2010 to 2020 using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) database to identify trends and demographic disparities. A retrospective analysis was conducted using the CDC WONDER Database, focusing on mortality data associated with specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for obesity (E66.0, E66.1, E66.2, E66.8, and E66.9). Data were extracted for the period from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Mortality rates per 100,000 population were calculated and analyzed across different demographic groups, including age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The analysis revealed an overall increase in obesity-related mortality rates, rising from 1.8 per 100,000 in 2010 to 3.1 per 100,000 in 2020. Age-specific mortality rates showed a significant increase in older age groups, with the highest rates observed in individuals aged 55-64 years (6.4 per 100,000) and 65-74 years (7.2 per 100,000). Gender disparities were evident, with higher mortality rates in males (3.4 per 100,000) compared to females (2.8 per 100,000) by the end of the study period. Racial disparities were also noted, with Black or African American individuals experiencing the highest mortality rates (4.3 per 100,000). The study highlights a concerning upward trend in obesity-related mortality in the United States over the past decade, with notable disparities based on age, gender, and race. These findings underscore the need for targeted public health interventions and policies aimed at reducing obesity prevalence and its associated mortality. Further research should explore the underlying causes and contributing factors to these trends to develop effective strategies for obesity management and prevention. Among the notable strengths of this study include the observation that it leveraged a comprehensive and decade-long countrywide database with detailed and up-to-date ICD-10 codes and demographic data to offer in-depth insights into obesity-related disparities and mortality trends in the United States.

"39355476","Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity and Their Associated Risk Factors in School-Going Children in North Karnataka City.","Background Malnutrition presents threats to human health, including undernutrition and overweight. Obesity is becoming a worldwide problem affecting all levels of society. Therefore, it is described as a global epidemic with a more pronounced impact in developing countries undergoing rapid epidemiological transitions. An increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity is associated with potential medical complications of obesity in adulthood. The purpose of the study is to estimate the prevalence of obesity and risk factors associated with obesity in school-going children of north Karnataka city. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in schools in north Karnataka city on 1330 school-going children 10-17 years of age. The overweight and obesity groups were considered using an updated BMI reference of children from two to 18 years ago, according to the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), and a structured questionnaire was used to assess the socio-demographic characteristics. Chi-square test was used to find out the association between risk factors and overweight and obesity and p value of less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results The prevalence of obesity in this study was 6.5%. It was found that 64 (22.9%) of the children who were obese or overweight were 14 years of age. Eighty (16.6%) obese children belonged to class 4 socio-economic class and 140 (22.0%) obese children used motorized means of transport. The eating habits of obese children were assessed, and it was found that 151 (19.4%) children had mixed diets, 210 (18.5%) obese children consumed junk food, and 183 (19.3%) obese children drank carbonated drinks. Conclusion This study suggest that the prevalence of overweight and obesity varies remarkably with different socio-demographic factors. Prevention of childhood obesity is necessary because it is nearly impossible to get children to lose weight and maintain it. Preventive interventions are needed at the individual level to adopt healthy lifestyle behavior and policy-making levels to tackle the obesity problem in the country.","Anjali Pandey, Pooja Todalabagi","Cureus","2024Sep",NA
"39355401","The Effects of Anti-thyroid Drugs on Lipoproteins and Insulin Resistance in Graves' Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","Graves' disease (GD) is characterized by thyroid overactivity. Anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs), such as propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI), are commonly used for GD treatment, and studies have suggested a link between these drugs and elevated lipoprotein levels. However, data on their effects on lipoproteins, insulin resistance, or low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) levels are lacking, both in Indonesia and in other countries. This study investigated changes in lipoproteins, LDL-R, and insulin resistance markers with ATD treatment. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial entitled ""The Differential Effects of Propylthiouracil and Methimazole as Graves' Disease Treatment on Vascular Atherosclerosis Markers"" conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia. Thirty-seven newly diagnosed GD patients received MMI or PTU for 3 months. After 3 months of ATD treatment, LDL-R levels significantly decreased compared to baseline (197 vs. 144 ng/mL, p<0.001), while most lipoproteins, including TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, the cholesterol ratio, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, increased. Unexpectedly, neither the PTU nor MMI groups showed an increased dyslipidemia prevalence. Although body mass index increased significantly and fasting plasma glucose decreased slightly, no significant post-treatment change in insulin resistance was observed. The study received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (ref KET-784/UN.2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2019) and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05118542). ATD treatment for GD led to a significant increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, along with a reduction in LDL-R levels. Both PTU and MMI showed similar effects. These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of ATDs on lipoproteins and insulin resistance in GD patients.

"39355360","Longitudinal analysis of body dissatisfaction: the desire to be thinner among women in Japan during low-risk pregnancies.","Body dissatisfaction during pregnancy can significantly impact maternal and child health. Therefore, this longitudinal study investigated changes in body dissatisfaction using two figure rating scales developed from photographic digital data of Japanese pregnant women during the sixth and tenth months of pregnancy. Study participants were recruited at their sixth month prenatal visit at a primary maternity clinic in Japan from October 2014 to March 2015. Body dissatisfaction was estimated based on the perceived and ideal body sizes of 135 pregnant women, expressed as body mass index. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. The study found that body dissatisfaction in the tenth month was significantly higher than that in the sixth month. Among the participants, 75 (55.6%) and 79 (58.5%) experienced body dissatisfaction, desiring to be thinner (where perceived body size exceeded ideal body size) during the sixth and tenth months of pregnancy, respectively. Pregnant women who had body dissatisfaction and a desire to be thinner in the sixth month tended to experience an increase in body dissatisfaction by the tenth month compared to those without body dissatisfaction in the sixth month. During the sixth and tenth months, women with body dissatisfaction showed significantly larger perceived body sizes than those without body dissatisfaction. These results indicated that the use of a figure rating scale at the sixth month of pregnancy may help identify women with body dissatisfaction; moreover, perceived body size might be a key factor in preventing an increase in body dissatisfaction from the second to third trimesters.","Sayaka Tsuchiya, Masayuki Endo, Kazutomo Ohashi","Nagoya journal of medical science","2024Aug","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Longitudinal Studies; Japan; Adult; Body Dissatisfaction; Body Image; Body Mass Index; Surveys and Questionnaires"

This study aimed to investigate the incidence and type of first CV event in a broad cohort of Spaniards, focusing on age and sex differences. This was a retrospective study using the SIDIAP database. Subjects aged 30-89 years in 2010 were included. Individuals with prevalent CV disease or atrial fibrillation were excluded. Subjects were followed until the occurrence of a CV event, death, or the study end (December 2016). CV outcomes (coronary heart disease [CHD], cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease and heart failure [HF]) during follow-up were analyzed. Clinical, anthropometrical, and laboratory data were retrieved from clinical records. Overall, 3,769,563 at-risk individuals (51.2 ± 15.2 years) were followed for a median of 7 years. The cumulative incidence of a first CV event was 6.66% (men vs. women, 7.48% vs. 5.90%), with the highest incidence (25.97%) among individuals >75 years. HF (29%) and CHD (28.8%) were the most common first events overall; in men it was CHD (33.6%), while in women it was HF and cerebrovascular disease (37.4% and 27.4%). In younger age groups, CHD was more prevalent, with HF in older age groups. Baseline CV risks factors conferred more risk in younger ages and differed between men and women. The incidence and type of the first CV event in this Mediterranean region were significantly influenced by age and sex.

The influence of receptor polymorphisms on the outcomes of freeze-all cycles remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of FSHR N680S and LHCGR N312S polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in freeze-all cycles. Women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technology participated in this study. They were administered a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol, with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) dosages adjusted according to age, body mass index, antral follicle count, and individual hormonal responses. Additionally, human menopausal gonadotropin dosages were tailored based on the LHCGR N312S genetic variant. Analysis revealed no significant differences in age, body mass index, antral follicle count, or marital status across the genotypes of FSHR N680S and LHCGR N312S. However, notable differences were observed in the rFSH dosage required daily and in total among the FSHR polymorphism genotypes. Genotypes of the LHCGR polymorphism correlated with fewer stimulation days. A significant interaction was observed between the 2 polymorphisms concerning total rFSH dosage. The presence of serine in the FSHR polymorphism was associated with higher rFSH dosage requirements. Both FSHR N680S and LHCGR N312S polymorphisms significantly influenced clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes in freeze-all cycles, underscoring the potential of a pharmacogenomic approach to optimize hormone supplementation in controlled ovarian stimulation protocols during assisted reproductive technology treatments.","Jayesh Amin, Naga Sandhya Alle, Ami Patel, Bansi Prajapathi, Paresh Makwana, Jaya Prakash, Kota Murali Krishna","International journal of reproductive biomedicine","2024Jul",NA

We assessed the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing SPECT or PET stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Based on significant risk factors associated with an abnormal MPI, we developed a nomogram for each cohort as a pretest that would be helpful in decision-making for clinicians. A total of 6,854 patients with suspected CAD who underwent stress myocardial perfusion imaging by SPECT or PET/CT was studied. As part of the baseline examination, clinical teams collected information on traditional cardiovascular risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, angina, dyspnea, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD, and smoking. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was different in the two cohorts of patients undergoing SPECT (n = 4,397) or PET (n = 2,457) myocardial perfusion imaging. A statistical significance was observed in both cohorts for age, gender, and diabetes. At multivariable analysis, only age and male gender were significant covariates in both cohorts. The risk of abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging related to age was greater in patients undergoing PET (odds ratio 4% vs. 1% per year). In contrast, male gender odds ratio was slightly higher for SPECT compared to PET (2.52 vs. 2.06). In the SPECT cohort, smoking increased the risk of abnormal perfusion of 24%. Among patients undergoing PET, diabetes and hypertension increased the risk of abnormal perfusion by 63% and 37%, respectively. For each cohort, we obtained a nomogram by significant risk factors at multivariable logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve associated with the nomogram was 0.67 for SPECT and 0.73 for the PET model. Patients with suspected CAD belonging to two different cohorts undergoing SPECT or PET stress myocardial perfusion imaging can have different cardiovascular risk factors associated with a higher risk of an abnormal MPI study. As crude variables, age, gender, and diabetes were significant for both cohorts. Net of the effect of other covariates, age and gender were the only risk factors in common between the two cohorts. Furthermore, smoking and type of stress test were significant for the SPECT cohort, where as diabetes and hypertension were significant for the PET cohort. Nomograms obtained by significant risk factors for the two cohorts can be used by clinicians to evaluate the risk of an abnormal study.","Rosario Megna, Mario Petretta, Carmela Nappi, Roberta Assante, Emilia Zampella, Valeria Gaudieri, Teresa Mannarino, Adriana D'Antonio, Roberta Green, Valeria Cantoni, Mariarosaria Panico, Wanda Acampa, Alberto Cuocolo","Frontiers in nuclear medicine (Lausanne, Switzerland)","2024",NA

Since poor glycemic control enhances the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in individuals with diabetes, exploring the association between glycation and oxidative states in diabetes could also shed light on potential consequences. This study evaluated the effects of albuminuria on AGEs and AOPP levels and measured their relationship in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with or without albuminuria. A cross-sectional, matched case-control study was designed, including 38 T2D subjects with albuminuria and 38 matched T2D subjects with normoalbuminuria. Patients were matched by their body mass index (BMI), age, and duration of diabetes. The unadjusted and adjusted correlation between AGEs and AOPP in the studied groups were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Using ggplot2, the ties between these two biochemical factors in cases and controls were plotted. This study elucidated a significant association between AGEs and AOPP in participants with normoalbuminuria (r = 0.331, p-value < 0.05), which continued to be significant after controlling for BMI, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r = 0.355, p-value < 0.05).

Detecting SO in elderly women is important from the perspective of extending healthy life expectancy. While various indices of SO are currently used, there is no global consensus regarding diagnostic criteria for SO. This study aimed to examine the relationship between obesity indices (waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage (BFP)) and sarcopenia indices (total body muscle mass (TBM), appendicular lean mass (ALM), skeletal mass index (SMI)), and physical function (gait speed (GS), handgrip strength (HGS)). Subjects were 170 community-dwelling healthy elderly women aged 65-79 years (mean: 72.7 ± 5.78 years) who underwent measurements for WC, BMI, and BFP. A WC of ≥ 90cm was defined as the obese group, BMI was determined as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2) and a cutoff of ≥ 25 kg/m2 was used to define the obesity group. BFM was measured using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method and BFP was calculated from body weight and a cutoff of ≥ 30% was used to define the obesity group. TBM and ALM (kg) were measured using the BIA method, ALM (kg) was corrected for height (m2) to obtain SMI (kg/m2). Physical function was assessed by GS and HGS, which were measured by the 5-m walk test and a digital grip strength meter, respectively. When obesity was assessed using BMI, WC and BFP, obese individuals had higher TBM, ALM and SMI, and lower GS among the sarcopenia indicators. HGS did not differ significantly between the non-obese and obese groups. Our findings suggest HGS is thought to reflect muscle strength without being affected by obesity indices, suggesting that it may be useful in detecting possible sarcopenia in obese individuals.","Chihiro Nishida, Motoyuki Iemitsu, Toshiyuki Kurihara, Keiko Kishigami, Motohiko Miyachi, Kiyoshi Sanada","Journal of physiological anthropology","2024Oct01","Humans; Female; Sarcopenia; Aged; Body Mass Index; Obesity; Waist Circumference; Japan; Adipose Tissue; Hand Strength; Body Composition; East Asian People"

The overall mean SDI was 8.0 (95% CI: 7.9, 8.1). Participants in the highest SDI-quintile compared to lower quintiles were older, more often women, non-smokers, and alcohol abstainers. The highest mean SDI was seen in London (9.1; 95% CI: 8.9, 9.3), followed by rural Ghana (8.2; 95% CI: 8.0, 8.3), Amsterdam (7.9; 95% CI: 7.7, 8.1), Berlin (7.8; 95% CI: 7.6, 8.0), and urban Ghana (7.7; 95% CI: 7.5, 7.8). Compared to rural Ghana, the differences between study sites were attenuated after accounting for age, gender and energy intake. No further changes were observed after adjustment for lifestyle factors. The multi-dimensional SDI describes four dimensions of dietary sustainability in this Ghanaian population. Our findings suggest that living in Europe improved dietary sustainability, but the opposite seems true for urbanization in Ghana.","Akinkunmi Paul Okekunle, Mary Nicolaou, Manuela De Allegri, Karlijn A C Meeks, Hibbah Osei-Kwasi, Julia Stockemer, Ama de-Graft Aikins, Isaac Agbemafle, Silver Bahendeka, Daniel Boateng, Kerstin Klipstein-Grobusch, Erik Beune, Charles Agyemang, Matthias B Schulze, Ina Danquah","Nutrition journal","2024Oct01","Humans; Ghana; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; Diet, Healthy; Diet; Transients and Migrants; Life Style"
"39354502","Novel multifactor predictive model for postoperative survival in gallbladder cancer: a multi-center study.","Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, with limited survival profiles after curative surgeries. This study aimed to develop a practical model for predicting the postoperative overall survival (OS) in GBC patients. Patients from three hospitals were included. Two centers (N = 102 and 100) were adopted for model development and internal validation, and the third center (N = 85) was used for external testing. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Cox regression were used for feature selection. A nomogram for 1-, 3-, and 5-year postoperative survival rates was constructed accordingly. Performance assessment included Harrell's concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves. Kaplan-Meier curves were utilized to evaluate the risk stratification results of the nomogram. Decision curves were used to reflect the net benefit. Eight factors, TNM stage, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (aCCI), body mass index (BMI), R0 resection, blood platelet count, and serum levels of albumin, CA125, CA199 were incorporated in the nomogram. The time-dependent C-index consistently exceeded 0.70 from 6 months to 5 years, and time-dependent ROC revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of over 75% for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival. The calibration curves, Kaplan-Meier curves and decision curves also indicated good prognostic performance and clinical benefit, surpassing traditional indicators TNM staging and CA199 levels. The reliability of results was further proved in the independent external testing set. The novel nomogram exhibited good prognostic efficacy and robust generalizability in GBC patients, which might be a promising tool for aiding clinical decision-making.","Kaige Deng, Jiali Xing, Gang Xu, Ruixue Ma, Bao Jin, Zijian Leng, Xueshuai Wan, Jingyong Xu, Xiaolei Shi, Jiangchun Qiao, Jiayin Yang, Jinghai Song, Yongchang Zheng, Xinting Sang, Shunda Du","World journal of surgical oncology","2024Oct01","Humans; Gallbladder Neoplasms; Female; Male; Nomograms; Middle Aged; Survival Rate; Prognosis; Aged; ROC Curve; Follow-Up Studies; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Cholecystectomy"
"39354490","Association of preoperative frailty with risk of postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing craniotomy: a prospective cohort study.","Preoperative frailty is a risk factor associated with postoperative delirium (POD), which has attracted more attention from clinicians, but no research has shown that it is related to elderly patients undergoing craniotomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of preoperative frailty on POD in older patients, especially those who underwent craniotomy. From October 2022 to May 2023, older patients who underwent elective craniotomy were collected. Assess the occurrence of frailty using the FRAIL scale one day before surgery. Evaluate the occurrence of POD using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) within three days after surgery. Participants were divided into two groups, one group being POD, Logistic regression analysis was used to find the risk variables for POD, and the predictive value of preoperative frailty to POD was determined by using the operating characteristic curve of the subjects. A total of 300 patients were included in this study, among whom 83 patients (27.7%) exhibited preoperative frailty and 69 patients (23.0%) experienced POD. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicate that preoperative frailty (OR: 8.816, 95% CI: 3.972-19.572), preoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR: 0.893, 95% CI: 0.811-0.984), low BMI (OR: 0.793, 95% CI: 0.698-0.901), and prolonged operative duration (OR: 1.007, 95% CI: 1.004-1.010) are independent risk factors for POD in older patients who underwent craniotomy. We constructed a risk prediction model using these factors, which had an area under the ROC curve of 0.908 (95% CI: 0.869-0.947, P < 0.001). Preoperative frailty enhanced the discriminative ability of the prediction model by 0.037. POD was associated with a longer length of hospital stay and higher hospitalization costs. Preoperative frailty is an independent risk factor for POD in older patients undergoing elective craniotomy and can predict the occurrence of POD to a certain extent. In addition, early identification of patients at risk of malnutrition and appropriate surgical planning can reduce the incidence of POD.","Li Wei, Miao Liu, Shisi Zhang, Yujie Chen, Min Wu, Xiaomei Chen, Jia Liu, Yuxuan He, Xue Yang, Jishu Xian","BMC surgery","2024Oct01","Humans; Craniotomy; Male; Aged; Female; Prospective Studies; Frailty; Risk Factors; Postoperative Complications; Delirium; Aged, 80 and over; Risk Assessment; Preoperative Period; Frail Elderly"
"39354475","Machine learning model predicting factors for incisional infection following right hemicolectomy for colon cancer.","Colorectal cancer is a prevalent malignancy worldwide, and right hemicolectomy is a common surgical procedure for its treatment. However, postoperative incisional infections remain a significant complication, leading to prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and patient discomfort. Therefore, this study aims to utilize machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, deep learning models, and traditional logistic regression, to predict factors associated with incisional infection following right hemicolectomy for colon cancer. Clinical data were collected from 322 patients undergoing right hemicolectomy for colon cancer, including demographic information, preoperative chemotherapy status, body mass index (BMI), operative time, and other relevant variables. These data are divided into training and testing sets in a ratio of 7:3. Machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, and deep learning, were trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. The deep learning model exhibited the highest performance in predicting incisional infection, followed by random forest and logistic regression models. Specifically, the deep learning model demonstrated higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and F1 score compared to other models. These findings suggest the efficacy of machine learning models in predicting risk factors for incisional infection following right hemicolectomy for colon cancer. Machine learning models, particularly deep learning models, offer a promising approach for predicting the risk of incisional infection following right hemicolectomy for colon cancer. These models can provide valuable decision support for clinicians, facilitating personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.","Jiatong Li, Zhaopeng Yan","BMC surgery","2024Oct01","Humans; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Male; Female; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; Surgical Wound Infection; Aged; Risk Factors; Retrospective Studies; Logistic Models; Support Vector Machine"
"39354462","Hypertension in India: a gender-based study of prevalence and associated risk factors.","Hypertension, a major non-communicable disease, is responsible for a significant number of global deaths, including approximately 17.9 million yearly. The Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD 2019) estimates that 19% of global deaths are attributed to elevated blood pressure. India, with a population of over 1.4 billion, is facing a serious challenge in combating this silent killer. This study aims to analyze the gender-based prevalence of hypertension in India and explore its associated risk factors using data from the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). NFHS-5 collected data from 636,699 households across all states and union territories. The study includes standardized blood pressure measurements for 17,08,241 individuals aged 15 and above. The data were analyzed using Stata, employing descriptive statistics for the assessment of the prevalence and binary logistic regression to identify predictors of hypertension. The study found the overall prevalence of hypertension in India to be 22.6%, with men (24.1%) having a higher prevalence than women (21.2%). Prevalence increased with age, reaching 48.4% in individuals aged 60 and above. Urban residents had a slightly higher prevalence (25%) than rural residents (21.4%), indicating the rapid spread of hypertension across all populations. Regional variations were observed, with the highest prevalence in Sikkim (37.9%) and the lowest in Rajasthan (16.5%). Increasing age, urban residence, belonging to certain religions (Muslim and other than Hindu or Muslim), and being classified as Scheduled Tribes (ST) were associated with a higher likelihood of hypertension. Conversely, belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) or Other Backward Classes (OBC), being currently unmarried, and having higher education were associated with a lower likelihood of hypertension. Wealth index analysis revealed that those in the richest quintile were more likely to have hypertension. Behavioural risk factors, such as alcohol consumption, overweight, obesity, increased waist circumference, and high blood glucose levels, are positively associated with hypertension. Hypertension is a significant health burden in India, affecting both men and women. Age is the strongest non-modifiable predictor for both men and women. However, ageing women have higher odds of hypertension than ageing men, and this distinction becomes much more evident in their older ages. Obese women, based on BMI, have higher odds of hypertension than men. However, hypertension prevalence is slightly higher among men who are overweight or obese compared to women. BMI, waist circumference, random glucose level, alcohol use, and education level emerged as major predictors. Health education and awareness campaigns are critical to control the growing burden of hypertension in India. Policymakers must focus on preventive measures, targeting lifestyle changes and improved healthcare access for both men and women. By addressing these risk factors, India can make significant progress in controlling hypertension and reducing its impact on public health.","Raza Mohammad, Dhananjay W Bansod","BMC public health","2024Oct01","Humans; India; Male; Hypertension; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Young Adult; Adolescent; Aged; Health Surveys; Sex Factors; Sex Distribution; Rural Population; Urban Population"

Despite this, identifying OA patients at high risk for preoperative DVT and appropriately targeting them for venous ultrasound screening remains a challenge. There is limited research-based evidence on the risk factors for preoperative DVT in elderly patients with end-stage OA. We examined the incidence of and risk factors for preoperative DVT in elderly patients with end-stage OA scheduled for total knee arthroplasty. We retrospectively analyzed the demographic data (age, sex, body mass index, current smoking, alcohol consumption, walking status, and Barthel index score), medical history, and laboratory test indices of 1411 patients with end-stage OA aged ≥ 60 years scheduled for total knee arthroplasty from January 2015 to December 2018. Risk factors for preoperative DVT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic analyses. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine optimal cut-off values. The incidence of preoperative DVT was 4.5% (63 of 1411 patients). Seven independent risk factors were correlated with preoperative DVT in the multivariate logistic regression: age (odds ratio [OR], 1.073; P = 0.002), D-dimer concentration (OR, 1.173; P = 0.003), hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.038; P = 0.045), atrial fibrillation (OR, 4.004; P = 0.033), chronic renal failure (OR, 6.732; P = 0.008), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 8.721; P = 0.001), and walking status (wheelchair) (OR, 2.697; P = 0.002). The optimal cut-off values for predicting preoperative DVT were 0.585 µg/mL for the D-dimer concentration (area under the curve [AUC], 0.769; P < 0.001) and 72.5 years for age (AUC, 0.668; P < 0.001). Among elderly patients with end-stage OA, venous ultrasonography to rule out DVT risk should be prioritized in those with a high D-dimer concentration (> 0.585 µg/mL), high age (> 72.5 years), hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, COPD, and walking status (wheelchair).","Yi-Feng Guo, Na Gao, Yaping Chen, Aimin Guo, Wei Han, Xisheng Weng, Jin Lin, Jin Jin, Wenwei Qian, Yan Zhang, Yufen Ma, Weinan Liu, Yin-Ping Zhang, Xiaopeng Huo","BMC musculoskeletal disorders","2024Oct01","Humans; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Male; Retrospective Studies; Female; Risk Factors; Venous Thrombosis; Aged; Incidence; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Middle Aged; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products; Aged, 80 and over; Postoperative Complications; Age Factors; Preoperative Period"

The aim of the present study was to analyze the prognostic role of radiomics values of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in APE. Overall, 508 patients were included into the study, 209 female (42.1%), mean age, 64.7 ± 14.8 years. 4.6%and 12.4% died (7- and 30-day mortality, respectively). For external validation, a cohort of 186 patients was further analysed. 20.2% and 27.7% died (7- and 30-day mortality, respectively). CTPA was performed at admission for every patient before any previous treatment on multi-slice CT scanners. A trained radiologist, blinded to patient outcomes, semiautomatically segmented the EAT on a dedicated workstation using ImageJ software. Extraction of radiomic features was applied using the pyradiomics library. After correction for correlation among features and feature cleansing by random forest and feature ranking, we implemented feature signatures using 247 features of each patient. In total, 26 feature combinations with different feature class combinations were identified. Patients were randomly assigned to a training and a validation cohort with a ratio of 7:3. We characterized two models (30-day and 7-day mortality). The models incorporate a combination of 13 features of seven different image feature classes. We fitted the characterized models to a validation cohort (n = 169) in order to test accuracy of our models. We observed an AUC of 0.776 (CI 0.671-0.881) and an AUC of 0.724 (CI 0.628-0.820) for the prediction of 30-day mortality and 7-day mortality, respectively. The overall percentage of correct prediction in this regard was 88% and 79% in the validation cohorts. Lastly, the AUC in an independent external validation cohort was 0.721 (CI 0.633-0.808) and 0.750 (CI 0.657-0.842), respectively.

"39354430","Prediction model for spontaneous preterm birth less than 32 weeks of gestation in low-risk women with mid-trimester short cervical length: a retrospective cohort study.","A short cervix in mid-trimester pregnancy is a risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth. However, there is currently a lack of predictive models and classification systems for predicting spontaneous preterm birth in these patients, especially those without additional risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. A retrospective observational cohort study of low-risk singleton pregnant women with a short cervix (≤ 25 mm) measured by transvaginal ultrasonography between 22 and 24 weeks was conducted. A multivariate logistic regression model for spontaneous preterm birth < 32 weeks in low-risk pregnant women with a short cervix was constructed. Moreover, we developed a nomogram to visualize the prediction model and stratified patients into three risk groups (low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups) based on the total score obtained from the nomogram model. Between 2020 and 2022, 213 low-risk women with a short cervix in mid-trimester pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Univariate logistic analysis revealed that a high body mass index, a history of three or more miscarriages, multiparity, a short cervical length, leukocytosis, and an elevated C-reactive protein level were associated with spontaneous preterm birth < 32 weeks, but multivariate analysis revealed that multiparity (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.13-9.68), leukocytosis (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.24-12.61) and a short cervical length (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) were independent predictors of sPTB < 32 weeks. The model incorporating these three predictors displayed good discrimination and calibration, and the area under the ROC curve of this model was as high as 0.815 (95% CI, 0.700-0.931). Patients were stratified into low- (195 patients), intermediate- (14 patients) and high-risk (4 patients) groups according to the model, corresponding to patients with scores ≤ 120, 121-146, and > 146, respectively. The predicted probabilities of spontaneous preterm birth < 32 weeks for these groups were 6.38, 40.62, and 71.88%, respectively. A noninvasive and efficient model to predict the occurrence of spontaneous preterm birth < 32 weeks in low-risk singleton pregnant women with a short cervix and a classification system were constructed in this study and can provide insight into the optimal management strategy for patients with different risk stratifications according to the score chart.","Xiaoxiu Huang, Yimin Zhou, Bingqing Liu, Yuhui Huang, Mengni Wang, Na Li, Baohua Li","BMC pregnancy and childbirth","2024Oct01","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Premature Birth; Adult; Cervix Uteri; Cervical Length Measurement; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Nomograms; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Logistic Models; Gestational Age"

This study aimed to investigate the risk factors and clinical outcomes of seroma formation in patients undergoing LIHR. From January 2016 to March 2023, clinical data of patients who underwent LIHR were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who developed seroma and those who did not were classified into the seroma and non-seroma groups, respectively. The demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for variables of interest. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the risk factors of the binary logistic model, and the cutoff value for each risk factor was obtained. Data of 128 patients were evaluated. Compared with patients in the non-seroma group, those in the seroma group had a higher body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.001), more direct hernias (P < 0.001), larger hernial orifice size (P < 0.001), more laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernioplasty (TEP) (P < 0.001), more frequent reduction of hernial sac (P = 0.011), and lower preoperative serum albumin level (PSAL) (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses performed on these variables showed that high BMI (P = 0.005), large hernial orifice (P = 0.001), TEP (P = 0.033), and low PSAL (P = 0.009) were risk factors for seroma formation. Compared with the non-seroma group, the seroma group exhibited a higher numerical rating scale score for postoperative pain (P < 0.001), and longer hospital stays (P = 0.032). BMI (> 24.5 kg/m2), hernial orifice size (> 2.5 cm), TEP, and PSAL (< 32.5 g/L) were independent risk factors of postoperative seroma formation in patients who underwent LIHR.

"39354420","The influence of genotype makeup on the effectiveness of growth hormone therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare multisystemic hereditary illness. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy is widely recognized as the primary treatment for PWS. This study aimed to examine how different PWS genotypes influence the outcome of rhGH treatment in children with PWS. A review was conducted on 146 Chinese children with PWS, genetically classified and monitored from 2017 to 2022. Unaltered and modified generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to examine the long-term patterns in primary outcomes (growth metrics) and secondary outcomes (glucose metabolism metrics and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)) during rhGH therapy. The study also evaluated the prevalence of hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and scoliosis before and after rhGH treatment. Children with PWS experienced an increase in height/length standard deviation scores (SDS) following rhGH administration. The impact of rhGH therapy on growth measurements was similar in both the deletion and maternal uniparental diploidy (mUPD) cohorts. Nevertheless, the deletion group was more prone to insulin resistance (IR) compared to the mUPD group. No significant variations in growth metrics were noted between the two groups (P > 0.05). At year 2.25, the mUPD group showed a reduction in fasting insulin (FINS) levels of 2.14 uIU/ml (95% CI, -4.26, -0.02; P = 0.048) and a decrease in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) of 0.85 (95% CI, -1.52, -0.17; P = 0.014) compared to the deletion group. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the IGF standard deviation scores (SDS) by 2.84 (95% CI, -4.84, -0.84; P = 0.005) in the mUPD group during the second year. The frequency of hip dysplasia was higher in the mUPD group compared to the deletion group (P < 0.05). rhGH treatment effectively increased height/length SDS in children with PWS, with similar effects observed in both deletion and mUPD genotypes. Children with mUPD genetype receiving rhGH treatment may experience enhanced therapeutic effects in managing PWS.","Qiong Zhou, Yun-Qi Chao, Yang-Li Dai, Ying Gao, Zheng Shen, Guan-Ping Dong, Chao-Chun Zou","BMC pediatrics","2024Oct01","Humans; Prader-Willi Syndrome; Human Growth Hormone; Child; Female; Male; Genotype; Child, Preschool; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Adolescent; Treatment Outcome; Recombinant Proteins; Infant; Hypothyroidism; Insulin Resistance"

We have investigated the clinicoepidemiological characteristics of female and young adult patients with AEGJ and the 12-year trends in the Kurashiki area for young adult patients with AEGJ. Patients diagnosed with AEGJ in 12 hospitals between January 2008 and December 2019 were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups by age (young adult [≤50 years], middle-aged [51 to 70 years], and elderly [>70 years]). Factors associated with AEGJ such as obesity, smoking, hiatal hernia and male, which were reported in our previous study, were identified. One hundred and eighty-eight AEGJ patients, including 36 females and 20 young adults, were characterized. There was no significant change in the annual incidence of AEGJ among female (p=0.078) and young adult patients (p=0.89). Female patients without any associated factors, accounting for 53% (19/36) of the female patients and young adult patients, had significantly more histologically undifferentiated cancers than patients with at least one associated factor (58% [11/19] vs. 30% [50/169], p=0.025) and middle-aged and elderly patients (60% [12/20] vs. 30% [25/83] vs. 28% [24/85], p =0.026). Smoking was significantly less common in women than in men (8% [3/36] vs. 57% [87/152], p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between ages in the proportions of these associated factors. Histologically undifferentiated AEGJ cancers were more frequent in female patients without any associated factors and in young adult patients. Factors associated with AEGJ may differ between women and men, but they are similar in young adults and older adults.

This study evaluated the optimal surgical timing and efficacy of preoperative percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) for patients with severe AC. Data of 142 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for severe AC between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively collected from the multi-institutional database of the Hiroshima Surgical Study Group of Clinical Oncology. Patients were divided into the early cholecystectomy (EC) group (within 72 h of symptom onset) and delayed cholecystectomy (DC) group. They were also subdivided into the upfront cholecystectomy group and preoperative PC before cholecystectomy group. The diagnosis and severity of AC were graded according to the Tokyo Guidelines 2018. Clinicopathological variables and outcomes were compared. No significant differences in age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and Charlson comorbidity index between the EC and DC groups were observed. Preoperative drainage was more commonly performed for the DC group than for the EC group. Local severe AC features were more commonly detected in the DC group than in the EC group. The postoperative outcomes of the EC and DC groups were comparable. Compared to the PC before cholecystectomy group, the upfront cholecystectomy group included more patients with ASA physical status ≥ 3 and more patients who used oral warfarin. Warfarin usage and cardiovascular dysfunction rates of the PC after cholecystectomy group were higher than those of the upfront cholecystectomy group. PC was associated with significantly less intraoperative bleeding and shorter hospital stays. Patients who can tolerate general anesthesia are good candidates for EC. Patients who use warfarin and those with cardiovascular dysfunction are considered to be at high risk for postoperative complications; therefore, to prevent AC recurrence during the waiting period, PC before cholecystectomy during the same admission is more appropriate than upfront cholecystectomy for these patients.","Tomoyuki Abe, Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, Shintaro Kuroda, Michinori Hamaoka, Hiroaki Mashima, Takashi Onoe, Naruhiko Honmyo, Koichi Oishi, Hideki Ohdan","BMC gastroenterology","2024Oct01","Humans; Cholecystitis, Acute; Retrospective Studies; Male; Female; Cholecystostomy; Aged; Cholecystectomy; Middle Aged; Preoperative Care; Treatment Outcome; Time-to-Treatment; Severity of Illness Index; Postoperative Complications; Japan; Databases, Factual; Aged, 80 and over; Length of Stay"
"39354353","Household income is associated with attack frequency, but not with the prevalence of headache: an analysis of self-reported headache in the general population in Germany.","Headache disorders are among the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide. However, whether groups differing in socioeconomic position (SEP) are disproportionately affected by headache disorders has not yet been adequately clarified. Our aim was to analyse (1) the headache prevalence by socioeconomic position (SEP) and (2) the attack frequency by SEP in a German population-based adult sample. Cross-sectional data from a random general population were used. The sample included N = 2,189 participants aged ≥ 18 years. SEP was measured using net equivalised income (NEI) and education. A binary logistic regression model tested the effect of SEP in predicting the prevalence of headache in general. Ordinal logistic regressions were modeled to predict the effect of SEP on the likelihood of attack frequency. Attack frequency was categorized in low frequency episodic headache (LFEH: 0-3 days per month), moderate frequency episodic headache (MFEH: 4-14 days per month) and chronic headache (CH: ≥ 15 days per month). Of the 2,189 participants, 891 reported headache in the last six months. Neither income nor education was associated with headache prevalence. However, significant differences between income groups were found for attack frequency.

"39354336","Screen time, sleep duration, leisure physical activity, obesity, and cardiometabolic risk in children and adolescents: a cross-lagged 2-year study.","Considering the previous research that suggested that screen time (ST), sleep duration, physical activity (PA), obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors are related, it is essential to identify how these variables are associated over time, to provide knowledge for the development of intervention strategies to promote health in pediatric populations. Also, there is a lack of studies examining these associations longitudinally. The aims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the longitudinal relationships between ST, sleep duration, leisure PA, body mass index (BMI), and cardiometabolic risk score (cMetS) in children and adolescents; and (2) to verify scores and prevalence of cMetS risk zones at baseline and follow-up. This observational longitudinal study included 331 children and adolescents (aged six to 17 years; girls = 57.7%) from schools in a southern city in Brazil. ST, sleep duration, and leisure PA were evaluated by a self-reported questionnaire. BMI was evaluated using the BMI z-scores (Z_BMI). The cMetS was determined by summing sex- and age-specific z-scores of total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, triglycerides, glucose, and systolic blood pressure and dividing it by four. A two-wave cross-lagged model was implemented. ST, sleep duration, and leisure PA were not associated with cMetS after 2-years. However, it was observed that higher ST at baseline was associated with shorter sleep duration at follow-up (B=-0.074; 95%IC=-0.130; -0.012), while higher Z_BMI from baseline associated with higher cMetS of follow-up (B = 0.154; 95%CI = 0.083;0.226). The reciprocal model of relationships indicated that the variance of ST, sleep time, leisure PA, Z_BMI, and cMetS explained approximately 9%, 14%, 10%, 67% and 22%, respectively, of the model. Individual change scores and prevalence indicated that cMetS had individual changes from 2014 to 2016. Sleep duration, ST and leisure PA were not associated with cMetS after 2 years. ST showed an inverse association with sleep duration, and Z_BMI was positively associated with cMetS after a 2-year follow-up. Finally, the prevalence of no clustering of risk factors increased after two years. These findings suggest the need to promote healthy lifestyle habits from childhood and considering individual factors that can influence cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents.","Ana Paula Sehn, João Francisco de Castro Silveira, Caroline Brand, Vanilson Batista Lemes, Letícia Borfe, Luciana Tornquist, Karin Allor Pfeiffer, Jane Dagmar Pollo Renner, Lars Bo Andersen, Ryan Donald Burns, Cézane Priscila Reuter","BMC cardiovascular disorders","2024Oct01","Humans; Female; Male; Child; Adolescent; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Sleep; Exercise; Screen Time; Time Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Leisure Activities; Risk Assessment; Pediatric Obesity; Brazil; Prevalence; Age Factors; Body Mass Index; Adolescent Behavior; Child Behavior; Cardiovascular Diseases; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep Duration"
"39354223","Sport participation, weight status, and physical fitness in French adolescents.","The primary objective of this study was to investigate the associations between sport participation and weight status with physical fitness among French adolescents. The secondary aim was to establish sex- and age-specific physical fitness percentiles for French adolescents. The sample comprised 8084 adolescents (4126 boys, 3958 girls), aged 10-14 years. Participants were tested on cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength using the following tests: 20-m shuttle run test and handgrip strength test. A questionnaire on organized sport participation was completed. Physical fitness levels were better in boys (P < 0.005). Handgrip strength increased with age whereas 20-m shuttle run performance decreased with age. Overweight and obese adolescents had significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels than their normal-weight peers (P < 0.005), whereas normal-weight adolescents had lower cardiorespiratory fitness than thin adolescents (P < 0.005). Sport participation was higher for boys (57.2% boys vs. 52.8% girls) (P < 0.001). Adolescents who participated in at least one organized sport (either through a club or at school) were fitter than those who did not participate in organized sports (P < 0.005). Adolescents who engaged in organized sports were more active and physically fit than those who did not participate. The fitness benefits of club sports are greater than those provided by school-based sports, highlighting the potential of sports clubs as a key setting for promoting health. What is Known: • Physical fitness is a strong marker of health in children and adolescents. • The last French Report Card highlighted the lack of fitness data and the need for nationwide programs, while showing a significant decline in cardiorespiratory fitness among youth in recent decades.. What is New: • This study reveals that adolescents participating in organized sports have better physical fitness compared to their peers who do not, emphasizing the potential advantages of club sports over school-based activities. • We highlight the need for targeted strategies, particularly for overweight or obese adolescents and girls, to increase participation in organized sports and enhance health outcomes. • The study emphasizes the need to develop policies that improve access to organized sports clubs and expand physical education in schools, aiming to improve CRF in adolescents.","Jérémy Vanhelst, Anne Le Cunuder, Luc Léger, Martine Duclos, Daniel Mercier, François Carré","European journal of pediatrics","2024Oct01",NA

This systematic review aimed to assess the pooled prevalence and risk factors for complications and failure of the KP. This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)-compliant systematic review (CRD42023416961) searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies on adult patients with Kock continent ileostomy published after the year 2000. The main outcome measures were revision, complications, and failure of the KP. Risk factors for complications and failure were assessed using a meta-regression analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-1 tool. A proportional meta-analysis of the main outcomes was performed. A total of 19 studies (2042 patients) were included. The weighted mean prevalence of complications was 60.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 46.1-74.7%], of pouch revision was 46.6% (95% CI: 38.5-54.7%), and of pouch failure was 12.9% (95% CI: 9.3-16.4%). Studies conducted in the USA had a mean failure prevalence of 12.6% (95% CI: 6.2-18.9%) comparable to studies conducted in Europe (11.1%; 95% CI: 7.5-14.7%). Factors associated with higher complications were increased body mass index (BMI) and previous ileoanal pouch anastomosis (IPAA); however, these factors were not associated with increased pouch failure. The KP is a highly complex operation as shown by a pooled complication prevalence of 60%, and thus, it should be only performed by experienced surgeons. Despite the high prevalence of complications and need for revisional surgery, patients are keen to preserve their KP. Increased BMI and a previous failed IPAA are risk factors for pouch complications, but not failure.","S H Emile, Z Garoufalia, S Mavrantonis, P Rogers, S H Barsom, N Horesh, R Gefen, S D Wexner","Techniques in coloproctology","2024Oct01","Humans; Reoperation; Postoperative Complications; Ileostomy; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Treatment Failure; Colonic Pouches; Female; Adult; Male; Proctocolectomy, Restorative; Middle Aged"
"39354070","Macrophages and T cells in metabolic disorder-associated cancers.","Cancer and metabolic disorders have emerged as major global health challenges, reaching epidemic levels in recent decades. Often viewed as separate issues, metabolic disorders are shown by mounting evidence to heighten cancer risk and incidence. The intricacies underlying this connection are still being unraveled and encompass a complex interplay between metabolites, cancer cells and immune cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME). Here, we outline the interplay between metabolic and immune cell dysfunction in the context of three highly prevalent metabolic disorders, namely obesity; two associated liver diseases, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH); and type 2 diabetes. We focus primarily on macrophages and T cells, the critical roles of which in dictating inflammatory response and immune surveillance in metabolic disorder-associated cancers are widely reported. Moreover, considering the ever-increasing number of patients prescribed with metabolism disorder-altering drugs and diets in recent years, we discuss how these therapies modulate systemic and local immune phenotypes, consequently impacting cancer malignancy. Collectively, unraveling the determinants of metabolic disorder-associated immune landscape and their role in fuelling cancer malignancy will provide a framework essential to therapeutically address these highly prevalent diseases.","Daniel Taranto, Daan J Kloosterman, Leila Akkari","Nature reviews.

"39354067","The association of leptin and incident hypertension in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke (REGARDS) cohort.","Leptin is an adipokine associated with obesity and with hypertension in animal models. Whether leptin is associated with hypertension independent of obesity is unclear. Relative to White adults, Black adults have higher circulating leptin concentration. As such, leptin may mediate some of the excess burden of incident hypertension among Black adults. REGARDS enrolled 30,239 adults aged ≥45 years from 48 US states in 2003-07. Baseline leptin was measured in a sex- and race-stratified sample of 4400 participants. Modified Poisson regression estimated relative risk (RR) of incident hypertension (new ≥140/≥90 mmHg threshold or use of antihypertensives) per SD of log-transformed leptin, stratified by obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2). Inverse odds ratio weighting estimated the % mediation by leptin of the excess hypertension RR among Black relative to White participants. Among the 1821 participants without prevalent hypertension, 35% developed incident hypertension. Obesity modified the relationship between leptin and incident hypertension (P-interaction 0.006) such that higher leptin was associated with greater hypertension risk in the crude model among those with BMI < 30 kg/m2, but not those with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. This was fully attenuated when adjusting for anthropometric measures. In the crude model, Black adults had a 52% greater risk of incident hypertension. Leptin did not significantly mediate this disparity. In this national U.S. sample, leptin was associated with incident hypertension among non-obese but not obese adults. Future investigations should focus on the effect of weight modification on incident hypertension among non-obese adults with elevated leptin.","S E Sherman, E Stoutenburg, D L Long, S P Juraschek, M Cushman, V J Howard, R P Tracy, S E Judd, D Kamin Mukaz, N A Zakai, T B Plante","Journal of human hypertension","2024Oct01",NA
"39354056","Normal caloric intake with high-fat diet induces metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and dyslipidemia without obesity in rats.","Excessive caloric intake and obesity due to high-fat (HFD) and high-disaccharide (HDD) diets have been recognized as major contributing factors to dyslipidemia and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the effect of HFD and HDD without excessive caloric intake is obscure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of physiological caloric intake delivered through HFD and HDD on liver and lipid profiles. The study was performed on 6-week-old male and female (50/50%) Sprague Dawley rats, receiving either a standard (controls, n = 16), HFD (n = 14) or HDD (n = 14) chow. All groups received the same, standard daily calorie rations, titrated weekly to the age of growing rats, for 12 weeks. A panel of metabolic in vivo measurement were performed, followed by histological, biochemical and molecular biology assays on tissues harvested from sacrificed rats. There was no significant difference between the groups in body weight. In contrast to controls, HFD and HDD groups showed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) characterized by liver steatosis, inflammation, ballooning of hepatocytes and fibrosis. These changes were more pronounced in the HFD than in the HDD group. The HFD group showed significantly higher serum LDL than controls or HDD rats. Furthermore, the HFD group had higher liver protein levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) but lower plasma levels of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) than the controls or HDD group. There were no differences between sexes in evaluated parameters. The excessive caloric intake and obesity are not prerequisites for the development of MASH and dyslipidemia in rats. The liver changes induced by the HFD and HDD diets exhibit differences in severity, as well as in the expression patterns of LDLR and PCSK9. Notably, these effects are independent of the sex of the rats.","Mateusz Szudzik, Tomasz Hutsch, Dawid Chabowski, Mikołaj Zajdel, Marcin Ufnal","Scientific reports","2024Oct01","Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Male; Dyslipidemias; Female; Energy Intake; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Obesity; Liver; Fatty Liver; Proprotein Convertase 9"
"39354032","Effect of low muscle mass on total mortality related to metabolic disease in chronic kidney disease patients.","Low muscle mass is a risk factor for mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it is not clear to what extent low muscle mass contributes to this risk, either independently or in combination with metabolic abnormalities and frailty. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2006 and 2011-2018. Low muscle mass was defined as Appendicular Skeletal Mass Index < 7 kg/m2 in men or < 5.5 kg/m2 in women. The follow-up duration was from the first anthropometric and clinical measurements to death or the last follow-up. This study enrolled 2072 patients with CKD. Low muscle mass was associated with a lower risk of metabolic abnormalities, but was associated with an elevated mortality risk. Conversely, central obesity was associated with a higher likelihood of metabolic abnormalities and frailty, yet showed no significant association with mortality risk. Subsequently conducted mediation analysis indicated that the effect of low muscle mass on mortality was direct, not mediated by frailty and metabolic abnormalities. In spite of the inverse relationship between low muscle mass and metabolic abnormalities, low muscle mass are directly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Low muscle mass may directly contribute to mortality in patients with CKD, independent of metabolic abnormalities and frailty in these patients.","Jong Wook Choi, Sung Hye Kong, Yoon Jung Kim, Hye Soo Chung, Jae Myung Yu, Joon-Sung Park, Chang Hwa Lee, Jung Hwan Park, Dong Sun Kim, Chang-Myung Oh, Shinje Moon","Scientific reports","2024Oct01","Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Metabolic Diseases; Nutrition Surveys; Muscle, Skeletal; Risk Factors; Frailty; Sarcopenia; Adult"

Of those that have, analyses have been limited to examinations of coding validity and trends among persons diagnosed with obesity (ICD-10, E66 code). This study aimed to explore the prevalence and predictors in E66 use across Canada two years prior to, and after the onset of Covid-19. This secondary analysis used the 2018-2022 Discharge Abstract Dataset of the Canadian Institute for Health Information. The sample consists of 166,335 individuals 20 to 64 years old across all provinces/territories, excluding Québec. Prevalence of E66 was assessed for each province, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds of E66 coding. Regional variations were present in E66 use, with Manitoba having the highest prevalence of coding. Of those with a E66 code, 98.7 % were within the obesity BMI category. In general, females of higher age, with one or more comorbidities, and shorter length of stay had higher odds of receiving the E66 code. Odds of E66 coding were also lower in females after the onset of Covid-19, whereas in males, only those with shorter length of hospital stay had consistently higher odds of diagnosis. This study offers new insight into E66 use across Canada, and points to the need for consistent acquisition of weight and height information, and the use of E66 coding within existing electronic medical records systems to inform inter-provincial care gaps for obesity-related care.","Parmis Mirzadeh, Jennifer L Kuk, Sean Wharton, Chris I Ardern","Obesity research & clinical practice","2024Sep30",NA
"39353500","Effect of food stimuli presentation on restrained eater's food choice: an ERP study.","Restrained eaters are individuals who consciously follow a limited food intake diet to lose or maintain body weight. With the rising numbers of obesity cases, retrained eating has became more prevalent as more people adopt it to cope with obesity. The dual conflict theory states that restrained eaters often encounter conflicting choices of food pleasure and weight management. The present study investigated the difference in food choice regarding different presentations of the weight management goal. The study hypothesized difference in successful and unsuccessful restrained eaters' food choice when presented with the conflicting food/weight maintenance stimuli. A total of 49 college students participated in the study and the N2, P3 and LPP event-related potentials (ERPs) were investigated during a food choice task. Results showed that the reaction time in unsuccessful restrained eaters (UREs) were greater than successful restrained eaters (SREs). The ERP results showed that SREs exhibited smaller N2 and greater P3 amplitudes than UREs, however, we did not find a difference in LPP amplitudes between the two groups. The findings suggest that the UREs demonstrated greater sensitivity and smaller inhibition to food cues, while we do not have supports for a difference in motivational and emotional salience. This is the first study that investigated the food choice of SREs and UREs when faced with different presentations of conflicting goals, which enriches the theoretical model and provides neural correlates evidence for future studies.","Yong Liu, Xuemeng Zhang, Yazhi Pang, Jia Zhao, Jinfeng Han, Yuanluo Jing, Hong Chen","Physiology & behavior","2024Sep29",NA

However, risk of eating disorders post-transplantation and factors influencing their onset remain poorly understood. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by characterizing the risk of having eating disorders or Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) according to the EAT-26, BES and Bratman screening questionnaires in 104 liver transplant recipients (mean age 62.5 years; median time from LT 6 years) with type 2 diabetes and/or overweight/obesity. Eighty-two patients (78.9 %) had diabetes; mean BMI was 30.1 ± 5.9 kg/m2. Risk of eating disorders was observed in 6.9 %-10.8 % and the risk of orthorexia (Bratman test score > 4) was observed in 60.5 % of patients. A significant association was found between BMI and the likelihood of having eating disorders considering EAT-26 (OR = 0.17, p = .009). The absence of a direct link between diabetes and the risk of having eating disorders suggest multifactorial influences on post-transplant eating behaviors. The study highlights the importance of proactive screening to evaluate eating behaviors in liver transplant recipients to define tailored interventions and optimize post-transplant outcomes. Limitations refer to the observational nature of the study and the absence of pre-transplant data. Further research is warranted to validate these findings, elucidate temporal relationship between transplantation and the onset of eating disorders, and explore potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Such insights are crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impact of eating disorders on post-transplant health and well-being.","Lucia Brodosi, Michele Stecchi, Giovanni Vitale, Beatrice Selvatici, Michela Genovese, Matteo Ravaioli, Matteo Cescon, Maria Cristina Morelli, Loris Pironi","Eating behaviors","2024Sep25",NA

The SUN Project is a dynamic cohort study designed to investigate multiple aspects of health and lifestyle. Participants were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire consisting of 556 items, that included a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Participants initially free of depression were classified as incident cases if they reported a medical diagnosis of depression during follow-up. Serum vitamin D levels were predicted by a previously validated equation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL. Cox models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

All patients diagnosed with RA, SLE, and scleroderma who underwent aesthetic surgery at our institution from 2003-2022 were reviewed. Demographic data, comorbidities, medications, procedures, and postoperative complications were collected. Non-CTD controls were identified for each procedure and matched 1:1 based on propensity scores derived from race, sex, body mass index, smoking status, and comorbidities. Six hundred 38 patients were included, comprising 319 (50%) patients diagnosed with CTD and 319 (50%) controls. The average age at surgery was 56.3 years. There were 129 complications. There were no differences between the CTD and non-CTD patients in number of total complications (69 versus 60, p = 0.38), major complications (23 versus 16, p = 0.25), or minor complications (46 versus 44, p = 0.73).

However, current epidemiological studies have yielded inconclusive findings. We aimed to estimate the associations of prenatal exposure to PFAS with offspring adiposity measures, and to explore the potential metabolic pathways underlying these associations. A total of 464 mother-child pairs from the Sheyang Mini Birth Cohort Study (SMBCS) were included in this study. Cord serum concentrations of 12 PFAS and urine metabolite profiles at age 10 were obtained from the SMBCS database. Adiposity-related anthropometric measurements and body composition estimates of children aged 10 were used to assess offspring obesity. Multiple linear regression models and quantile g-computation were conducted to estimate the associations of prenatal exposure to individual and multiple PFAS with obesity at 10 years old. Metabolomics analysis was performed to characterize the biological pathways associated with PFAS exposure or obesity, subsequently identifying the overlapping metabolic pathways underlying the PFAS-obesity relationship. Prenatal exposure to several PFAS was significantly associated with elevated obesity-related markers in 10-year-old children. After stratification by sex, the effects were more pronounced in girls. Quantile g-computation results indicated that exposure to higher levels of PFAS mixtures during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of obesity in girls, with PFNA emerging as the predominant driving compound. Untargeted metabolomics results showed that several amino acid metabolic pathways were characterized as the overlapping pathways underlying the above associations. Taken together, our findings suggested the potential obesogenic effects of prenatal exposure to PFAS and offered insight into the possible metabolic mechanisms underlying PFAS-related offspring obesity.","Zheng Wang, Boya Zhang, Jiming Zhang, Sinan Xu, Yiming Dai, Jiayun Ding, Jianqiu Guo, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiuli Chang, Chunhua Wu, Zhijun Zhou","Environment international","2024Sep25",NA
"39353184","Game-Based Assessment of Peripheral Neuropathy Combining Sensor-Equipped Insoles, Video Games, and AI: Proof-of-Concept Study.","Detecting peripheral neuropathy (PNP) is crucial in preventing complications such as foot ulceration. Clinical examinations for PNP are infrequently provided to patients at high risk due to restrictions on facilities, care providers, or time. A gamified health assessment approach combining wearable sensors holds the potential to address these challenges and provide individuals with instantaneous feedback on their health status. We aimed to develop and evaluate an application that assesses PNP through video games controlled by pressure sensor-equipped insoles. In the proof-of-concept exploratory cohort study, a complete game-based framework that allowed the study participant to play 4 video games solely by modulating plantar pressure values was established in an outpatient clinic setting. Foot plantar pressures were measured by the sensor-equipped insole and transferred via Bluetooth to an Android tablet for game control in real time. Game results and sensor data were delivered to the study server for visualization and analysis. Each session lasted about 15 minutes. In total, 299 patients with diabetes mellitus and 30 with metabolic syndrome were tested using the game application. Patients' game performance was initially assessed by hypothesis-driven key capabilities that consisted of reaction time, sensation, skillfulness, balance, endurance, and muscle strength. Subsequently, specific game features were extracted from gaming data sets and compared with nerve conduction study findings, neuropathy symptoms, or disability scores. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to 70% (n=122) of acquired data to train predictive models for PNP, while the remaining data were held out for final model evaluation. Overall, clinically evident PNP was present in 247 of 329 (75.1%) participants, with 88 (26.7%) individuals showing asymmetric nerve deficits. In a subcohort (n=37) undergoing nerve conduction study as the gold standard, sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities and nerve amplitudes in lower extremities significantly correlated with 79 game features (|R|>0.4, highest R value +0.65; P<.001; adjusted R2=0.36). Within another subcohort (n=173) with normal cognition and matched covariates (age, sex, BMI, etc), hypothesis-driven key capabilities and specific game features were significantly correlated with the presence of PNP. Predictive models using selected game features achieved 76.1% (left) and 81.7% (right foot) accuracy for PNP detection. Multiclass models yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (left foot) and 0.72 (right foot) for assessing nerve damage patterns (small, large, or mixed nerve fiber damage). The game-based application presents a promising avenue for PNP screening and classification. Evaluation in expanded cohorts may iteratively optimize artificial intelligence model efficacy.

Medication-free participants (n=177) were classified as normoinsulinemic (NI) or hyperinsulinemic (HI) and as having low (LF) or high (HF) liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fractional gluconeogenesis (frGNG) and hepatic DNL were measured using stable isotope tracer methodology following an overnight fast. Although HI and HF groups had higher fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations when compared to NI and LF groups respectively, there was no difference in frGNG. However, HF participants tended to have lower frGNG than LF participants. HI participants had higher DNL compared to NI participants but there was no difference observed between liver fat groups. Taken together, we found no metabolic signature of selective hepatic IR in fasting humans. DNL may contribute to hypertriglyceridemia in individuals with HI but not those with HF. Glycogenolysis and systemic glucose clearance may have a larger contribution to fasting hyperglycemia than gluconeogenesis, especially in those with HF and these pathways should be considered for therapeutic targeting.","Felix A Westcott, Shilpa R Nagarajan, Sion A Parry, Dragana Savic, Charlotte J Green, Thomas Marjot, Elspeth Johnson, Thomas Cornfield, Ferenc E Mózes, Paige O'Rourke, Jessica Mendall, David Dearlove, Barbara Fielding, Kieran Smith, Jeremy W Tomlinson, Leanne Hodson","European journal of endocrinology","2024Oct01",NA

The aneuploidy rate, calculated as the ratio of aneuploid blastocysts to the total number of blastocysts biopsied in a single treatment cycle, was evaluated. In the embryo-level analysis, the main outcome measure was the ploidy state of the embryos. The study employed a multifaceted analytical approach that included a patient-level analysis using generalized linear mixed models, an embryo-level analysis focusing on chromosomal ploidy, and a propensity score matching analysis contrasting groups with distinct ploidy rates (0% and 100%). There were no interventions as this was an observational study of PGT-A cycles. No clinically relevant factors influencing ploidy rate related to male and sperm quality were revealed. In contrast, female age (coefficient = -0.053), BMI (coefficient = 0.003), prior ART cycle (coefficient = -0.066), and number of oocytes retrieved (coefficient = -0.018) were identified at the patient level. Embryo analysis identified age (coefficient = -0.1244) and ICSI usage (coefficient = -0.0129) as significant factors. Despite these, no significant interactions between male and female assessed factors on the ploidy rate emerged. Propensity score matching between maximal (100% vs 0%) euploid rates did not reveal significant differences of influence by male age and sperm quality. The focus on patients having blastocyst biopsy for PGT-A may not reflect the broader IVF population. Other semen quality parameters like DNA fragmentation were not included. Exclusion of embryo mosaicism from the analysis could affect aneuploidy rate interpretations. There may also be unmeasured influences like lifestyle or environmental factors. Male age and sperm quality parameters were consistent across both maximal and minimal ploidy rate comparisons. No significant clinical characteristics related to the factors assessed for the male-influenced blastocyst ploidy status, confirming the dominancy of the oocyte and female age. The study was not funded. There are no competing interests.

"39352915","Association between dietary copper intake and bone mineral density in children and adolescents aged 8-19 years: A cross-sectional study.","Some studies showed the possible role of copper intake on bone mineral density (BMD) in adults or the elderly, but the association remained uncertain in children and adolescents. Our research explored the association between copper intake and BMD in individuals aged 8-19 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016. In the present study, 6,965 individuals aged 8-19 (mean age 13.18 ± 3.38 years) were enrolled from the NHANES 2011-2016. Copper intake was evaluated by averaging two 24-hour copper dietary intake recalls. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between copper intake and total BMD, subtotal BMD, and total spine BMD in children and adolescents. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were performed by age, gender, and race. Participants of the higher quartile of copper intake were more likely to be older, men, Non-Hispanic White, and Other Hispanic. They have higher values of poverty income ratio (PIR), serum phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, serum vitamin D, and BMD and lower values of body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, total protein, and serum cotinine. In the fully adjusted model, we found positive associations between copper intake and total BMD (β = 0.013, 95CI: 0.006, 0.019)), subtotal BMD (β = 0.020, 95CI: 0.015, 0.024), and total spine BMD (β = 0.014, 95CI: 0.009, 0.019). Stratified analyses showed that the association was stronger in men, individuals aged 14-19, Non-Hispanic White, and Other Hispanic. Our study suggests that copper intake is positively associated with BMD in U.S. children and adolescents. The study emphasizes the role of copper intake on bone health in the early stages of life. However, more investigations are needed to verify our findings and their underlying mechanisms.","Aiyong Cui, Juan Yan, Haoran Li, Zhiqiang Fan, Xing Wei, Hu Wang, Yan Zhuang","PloS one","2024","Humans; Adolescent; Male; Female; Copper; Bone Density; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Young Adult; Nutrition Surveys; Diet"

"39352781","The relationship between serum uric acid and gastrointestinal bleeding in peritoneal dialysis patients: a propensity score analysis.","Gastrointestinal bleeding is an important gastrointestinal complication among peritoneal dialysis patients and correlated with a higher risk of mortality. Increased uric acid levels are a significant complication for peritoneal dialysis patients and have been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between serum uric acid levels and gastrointestinal bleeding in peritoneal dialysis patients. A total of 2498 peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited. Based on the optimal uric acid cutoff value, two groups of patients were divided. We constructed a propensity-score-matched population of 1762 patients by matching sex, age, and body mass index. Survival outcomes between the two groups were compared using adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves. We constructed the restricted cubic splines regression to assess the correlation between levels of uric acid and gastrointestinal bleeding. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to test whether higher levels of uric acid are an independent risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding. We performed a forest plot to show interaction effects in different subgroups. According to restricted cubic splines regression, uric acid levels were positively correlated with the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding events. After adjusted different confounding factors, patients with high levels of uric acid were prone to experience gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 1.868, 95%CI 1.001-3.486). In subgroups, the interaction between higher levels of uric acid and utilizing proton pump inhibitors was significant (P for interaction = 0.034). Further research found that taking proton pump inhibitors could decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in peritoneal dialysis patients accompanied high levels of uric acid. The baseline high levels of uric acid are an independent risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.","Guowen Zhao, Yijia Zheng, Na Tian, Xiaojiang Zhan, Fenfen Peng, Xiaoyang Wang, Yueqiang Wen, Qingdong Xu, Xiaoran Feng, Xingming Tang, Xianfeng Wu, Qian Zhou, Sijia Shang, Yuanyuan Yang, Hongrui Shi, Ning Su","Renal failure","2024Dec","Humans; Uric Acid; Male; Female; Propensity Score; Middle Aged; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Peritoneal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Adult; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Proportional Hazards Models; Kidney Failure, Chronic"
"39352778","Assessment of correlation between lipid ratios and body mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Objective. Studies that have evaluated correlation between body mass index (BMI) and novel lipid indices such as triglycerides (TG)/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are scarce. Hence, the aim of the present study was to explore the correlation between BMI and novel lipid indices in Bosnian patients with T2DM. Methods. Present study included 117 patients with T2DM (mean age: 66.51 years) and 68 controls (mean age: 68.37 years). BMI was calculated as weight/height². Lipids were measured by standard methods. TG/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios were separately calculated. The differences between the groups were assessed by Student's t-test or Man Whitney U test. Correlations were determined by Spearman's test. Results. In a total sample of T2DM patients, 41.0% were overweight and 44.4% were obese. In the control group, 51.5% of subjects were overweight and 25.0% were obese. In T2DM group, a significant correlation was observed between BMI and HDL-C, LDL-C, TG/HDL, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios. In the control group, there was a significant correlation found between BMI and HDL-C, TG, TG/HDL, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C-ratios. Correlation between BMI and other lipid parameters in T2DM and the control group was not determined. Conclusion. The present study showed significant correlation between BMI and novel lipid indices in both T2DM patients and the control group of subjects. Possible explanation for the observed results might be prevalence of overweight and obese participants in this study sample. Since novel lipid indices are used in the prediction of cardiometabolic risk, results obtained in the present study have valuable clinical implications.","Carla Devantier-Du Plessis, Nadina Saric, Benjamin Devantier-Du Plessis, Asija Zaciragic","Endocrine regulations","2024Jan01","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Body Mass Index; Male; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Triglycerides; Cholesterol, HDL; Obesity; Cholesterol, LDL; Overweight; Lipids; Case-Control Studies"
"39352699","Depression and Anxiety Among US Children and Young Adults.","Data from surveys show increased mental health disorders in youths. However, little is known about clinical diagnosis over time. To assess the incidence, prevalence, and changes from 2017 to 2021 for depression and anxiety diagnosed clinically among children, adolescents, and young adults and to identify potential disparities. This cohort study included approximately 1.7 million individuals aged 5 to 22 years in Southern California. Data were extracted from electronic medical records; International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes were used to identify depression and/or anxiety diagnosis for each study year from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. Rates were stratified by age, gender, race and ethnicity, estimated household income, weight status, and comorbidity history. Changes over time and association with these variables were assessed using Poisson regression. Data were analyzed between June 1, 2022, and November 29, 2023. Clinical diagnosis of (1) depression and (2) anxiety without a depression diagnosis using ICD-10 codes. Among the 1.7 million participants, mean (SD) age was approximately 14 (5) years, and 51% were male. In terms of race and ethnicity for each study year, approximately 50% of participants were Hispanic; 8%, non-Hispanic Asian; 8%, non-Hispanic Black; and 23%, non-Hispanic White. From 2017 to 2021, depression diagnosis increased by 55.6% (from 1.35% to 2.10%) for incidence and 60.0% (from 2.55% to 4.08%) for prevalence; anxiety without depression diagnosis increased by 31.1% (from 1.77% to 2.32%) for incidence and 35.2% (from 3.13% to 4.22%) for prevalence (P < .001 for trend). The increases in rates were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) than before the pandemic (2017-2019), except for depression incidence. Rates increased across all subgroups. Rates were highest for subgroups aged 14 to 17 and 18 to 22 years; female participants; those of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic White, or multiple races or ethnicities; and subgroups with higher household income, obesity (and underweight for anxiety without depression), or comorbidities. Among these factors, age was the most important factor for depression diagnosis, whereas weight status was the most important factor for anxiety without depression diagnosis. This cohort study, using electronic medical record data from a large integrated health care system, found an increase in clinically diagnosed depression from 2017 to 2021, with a higher increase during the COVID-19 pandemic and higher rates in some subgroups. Equally important, this study identified high rates and an increase in clinical diagnosis of anxiety without a depression diagnosis. These results support the increased need in public health and health care effort to combat the mental health crisis in youths.","Anny H Xiang, Mayra P Martinez, Ting Chow, Sarah A Carter, Sonya Negriff, Breda Velasquez, Joseph Spitzer, Juan Carlos Zuberbuhler, Ashley Zucker, Sid Kumar","JAMA network open","2024Oct01","Humans; Adolescent; Female; Male; Young Adult; Child; Depression; Anxiety; Prevalence; COVID-19; Incidence; California; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; United States; SARS-CoV-2"
"39352629","Who and how to screen for endogenous hypercortisolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity.","The current review aims to summarize and discuss the prevalence of confirmed hypercortisolism in patients with diabetes mellitus or obesity, analysing the screening tests used and their accuracy, in order to better identify whether patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity should be screened for Cushing's syndrome (CS) and how. A narrative review was performed including publications focusing on the current knowledge on prevalence of confirmed hypercortisolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity and on screening tests used to detect CS. The studies reviewed suggest that the prevalence of CS in patients with T2DM is variable, ranging from 0.6 to 9.3%. The most used screening test is the overnight cortisol after 1 mg of dexamethasone suppression test (DST), with a false positive rate ranging from 3.7 to 21%. The prevalence of CS among obese patients is generally about 1%, except for two studies which reported higher prevalence. For obese patients, 1 mg DST and late-night salivary cortisol are the most accurate screening tests for CS. Clinical expertise remains the mainstay to identify which subjects should be screened for CS. The evaluation of the clinical stigmata of CS and the combination with clinical comorbidities typical of CS are the stronger predictors of CS. In addition, we could hypothesize that in patients with T2DM, overnight 1 mg DST is the more accurate screening test for CS. By contrast, in patients with obesity both LNSC and overnight 1 mg DST could be equally used for the screening of hypercortisolism.","Valentina Guarnotta, Carla Giordano, Giuseppe Reimondo","Journal of endocrinological investigation","2024Oct01",NA
"39352564","The relationship between nutritional status and prognosis in advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients in palliative care: a prospective cohort study.","The study aimed to determine the nutritional status and its prognostic effect on the survival of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. A prospective cohort study design was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. The study consisted of 202 advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients from a palliative care unit. The following data were collected from the patients: biochemical indicators, i.e., anemia (hemoglobin levels), albumin, pre-albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and anthropometric parameters, i.e., body mass index (BMI), nutritional status by Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and performance status by Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Severe malnutrition was confirmed with the PG-SGA score of ≥ 9. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were used to calculate overall survival (OS). The effect of nutritional status on survival was performed by Cox regression analysis. Severe malnutrition was found in 71.3% of patients according to the cutoff of the PG-SGA. PG-SGA score ≥ 9, albumin level < 35 g/L, and CRP level ≥ 10 mg/L predicted shortened life expectancy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed that the PG-SGA score ≥ 9 and the albumin level < 35 g/L were predictive of OS. Our data support that severe malnutrition is a predictor for OS in patients with advanced GI cancer. Information on nutritional status should be considered to individualize palliative care plan for these patients, and hence improve their quality of life.","Ting Mao, Janelle Yorke, Xiaoju Zhang, Yan Shi, Jingyi Wang, Xiaoqian Kong, Katherine Ka Wai Lam, Qi Liu, Funa Yang, Ka Yan Ho","Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","2024Oct01","Humans; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Male; Female; Prospective Studies; Nutritional Status; Palliative Care; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Aged; Malnutrition; China; Proportional Hazards Models; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Cohort Studies; Karnofsky Performance Status; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; C-Reactive Protein"
"39352426","Pelvic Floor Ultrasound Findings and Symptoms of Pelvic Floor Dysfunction During Pregnancy.","Pregnancy and childbirth predispose to pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD), coinciding with functional and anatomical changes in the pelvic floor. To some extent, these can be assessed by transperineal ultrasound (TPUS), yet the correlation between ultrasound findings and symptoms has not been well elucidated. We hypothesised that pregnant women with PFD would show different findings at TPUS. This is a planned secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. Pregnant women were asked to fill out standardised questionnaires on PFD and undergo TPUS at 12-14 weeks and 28-32 weeks of gestation. We compared bladder neck descent, urethral rotation, retrovesical angle, pelvic organ descent, genital hiatus dimensions and the presence of anal sphincter defects between women with and those without PFD using t test and Fisher's exact test. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the correlation between TPUS findings and PFD severity. As this is a secondary subgroup analysis of participants who underwent TPUS, no sample size was determined upfront. At Valsalva, women with urinary incontinence had more pronounced bladder neck descent (p = 0.02) and urethral rotation (p < 0.01), as well as wider retrovesical angles (p = 0.04) and larger genital hiatus areas (p < 0.01). After controlling for age, BMI and parity, the retrovesical angle was the only persistent predictor of urinary incontinence. No correlation was observed between any TPUS marker and symptoms of either prolapse or anorectal dysfunction. In pregnant women, symptoms of urinary incontinence, but not of prolapse and anorectal dysfunction, are associated with differences in pelvic floor anatomy at TPUS.","Laura Cattani, Dominique Van Schoubroeck, Adela Samešova, Bram Packet, Susanne Housmans, Jan Deprest","International urogynecology journal","2024Oct01",NA

To date, limited data are available regarding the impact of VLEDs prior to colorectal surgery. We designed this study to determine whether preoperative VLEDs benefit patients with obesity undergoing colorectal surgery. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Individuals undergoing elective colorectal surgery with a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30 kg/m2 from 2015 to 2022 were included. The exposure of interest was VLEDs for 2-4 weeks immediately prior to surgery. The control group consisted of patients prior to January 2018 who did not receive preoperative VLED. The primary outcome was 30 day postoperative morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine associations with 30 day postoperative morbidity. Overall, 190 patients were included, 89 patients received VLEDs (median age: 66 years; median BMI: 35.9 kg/m2; 48.3% female) and 101 patients did not receive VLEDs (median age: 68 years; median BMI: 32.1 kg/m2; 44.6% female). One-hundred four (54.7%) patients experienced 30 day postoperative morbidity. Multivariable regression analysis identified three variables associated with postoperative morbidity: VLEDs [odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.08-0.61, P < 0.01], Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.52, P = 0.02), and rectal dissections (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.30-5.65, P < 0.01). The use of a preoperative VLED was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative morbidity in patients with obesity prior to colorectal surgery.

We retrospectively identified 1,005 patients who underwent TFR at one institution by a single fellowship-trained, hand surgeon under WALANT from 2015 to 2023. Nine hundred ninety-two patients were treated with TFR alone. Twelve patients (1.2%) underwent USSR because of persistent triggering that was identified in the operating room after release of the A1 pulley. An age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched cohort of 28 patients who underwent TFR alone was created. Medical records were reviewed for demographics and complications. A total of 12 patients (14 digits) underwent TFR with USSR. The long finger was the most commonly affected finger (6, 42%). Patients in the USSR group had more average lifetime trigger fingers compared with the control group (4 vs 1). Additionally, the percentage of patients who had previously undergone TFRs for other fingers was higher in the USSR group (100%) compared with the control group (36%). After surgery, 6 patients (4 USSR and 2 control) underwent formal hand therapy for postoperative stiffness with USSR patients receiving therapy more often than controls. Although uncommon, some patients (1.2%) who undergo TFR require USSR for persistent triggering following A1 pulley release. Patients who have had more lifetime trigger fingers and/or who have previously undergone TFR for other fingers are more likely to need USSR. No serious complications were incurred by patients who underwent USSR, but these patients may benefit from hand therapy compared to those undergoing isolated TFR.

There is a widespread consensus that low back discomfort is a major contributor to both inabilities to work and illness. Absenteeism is frequently employed as a proxy for the presence of a handicap. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of LBP among nurses in six different wards in three general hospitals in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah as well as the associated workplace risk factors and coping strategies implemented by nurses in ward. A cross-sectional study involved 420 nurses from three public hospitals in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, was carried out. The respondents were carefully selected by proportionate stratified random sampling method. Nurses sociodemographic and occupational details, occupational health in nursing practice, seventeen work risk variables and nine coping techniques were collected via a selfadministered questionnaire. Among the 420 participants, 57 did not report any discomfort. In the previous 12 months, 44.5% (95.0% CI: 39.74,49.25) of nurses experienced low back discomfort lasting longer than three days. The results of a simple logistic regression analysis revealed that gender and years of working experience were significantly associated with LBP. The department of intensive care unit nurses had the highest OR value of 2.4 (p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant association with age, marital status and body mass index (p > 0.05). Adjusting plinth or bed height (68.4%) was the top coping mechanism cited by respondents in the clinical context to reduce the risk of LBP, and working with perplexed or agitated patients posed the greatest occupational risk. LBP is still a major work-related issue among nurses, with a high prevalence rate. To mitigate these impacts, multidisciplinary efforts are required. The outcomes of this study may help policy makers to allocate resources to reduce LBP among nurses.","A S Perumal, K Awang Lukman","The Medical journal of Malaysia","2024Sep","Humans; Low Back Pain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Adult; Hospitals, Public; Prevalence; Male; Risk Factors; Adaptation, Psychological; Malaysia; Occupational Diseases; Middle Aged; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Young Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Coping Skills"

We evaluated cross-sectional associations between VO2max and cardiometabolic risk variables (CMRV), and verified whether the associations were independent of adiposity markers in school-aged children and adolescents from Cali, Colombia. The sample consisted of 1206 children aged 5-17 years. CMRV were fasting glucose, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic, and diastolic pressure. Logistic regressions were conducted for associations of age/sex-specific tertiles of VO2max with age/sex-specific highest tertiles of CMRV (except HDL-C, lowest tertile) and a CMR cluster (> 2 CMRV in extreme tertiles), adjusting for socioeconomic stratum, and adiposity markers (BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference). Overweight/obesity ranged from 15% to 18% with no difference by sex. In children aged 5-11 years, high VO2max (highest tertile vs. lowest) was inversely associated with the CMR cluster [Odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.18 (0.06-0.47), p < 0.05] independently of adjustment for any adiposity marker in boys but not in girls. In the age group of 12-17 years, there were initially significant VO2max- CMR cluster and VO2max- CMRV associations but attenuated by adiposity adjustment. In girls, high VO2max was inversely associated with high systolic blood pressure regardless of adjustment for adiposity markers. VO2max is inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk, but adiposity influences the association. The adiposity-independent association among younger boys requires further research. Interventions to tackle cardiometabolic risk in childhood may primarily focus on reducing excess adiposity, and secondarily on improvement of CRF.","Ricardo Antonio Agredo-Zuñiga, Diana C Parra, José Guillermo Ortega-Ávila, Milton Fabian Suarez-Ortegon","American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council","2024Oct01",NA

This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the MedDiet adherence and anthropometric parameters in 9-year-old children from the central geographic locations of Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. The study analysed data obtained from 158 children aged nine years from central parts of Dalmatia: Split and Hvar. To assess the MedDiet adherence, the parents of the children filled out the Mediterranean Diet Index (KIDMED) questionnaire. Appointed school medicine specialists collected anthropometric data of the children and categorized them into body mass index (BMI) categories according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Additionally, we assessed the influence of parents' education degree on children's MedDiet adherence and anthropometric measures. Results showed that more than a quarter of nine-year-olds included in this study were overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age and sex). One of the main findings was that 72% of children had suboptimal (poor or average) MedDiet adherence. Moreover, children with suboptimal KIDMED results (KI < 8) had significantly higher body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-height ratio. Also, results showed that mothers' education notably influences children's anthropometry. Our study found that childhood obesity is a significant concern among 9-year-olds, with a high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Additionally, our results showed that MedDiet adherence is suboptimal among this age group. These results indicate that children of the Mediterranean are not spared of modern life challenges. This problem should be prioritized in the future to prevent the development of a metabolically compromised adult population.","Katarina Tomelić Ercegović, Petar Đolonga, Zvonimir Družianić, Vladimir Ercegović, Željka Karin","Central European journal of public health","2024Sep","Humans; Croatia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet, Mediterranean; Female; Male; Child; Pediatric Obesity; Body Mass Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Anthropometry"
"39352015","Exploring Biomarkers in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Among Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","Integrating biomarkers into a comprehensive strategy is crucial for precise patient management, especially considering the significant healthcare costs associated with diseases. Current studies emphasize the urgent need for a paradigm shift in conceptualizing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Biomarkers are emerging as indispensable tools for accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring disease progression. This review classifies biomarkers into conventional and novel categories, such as lipids, insulin resistance, hepatic function, and cutting-edge imaging/omics, and evaluates their potential to transform the approach to MASLD among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). It focuses on the critical role of biomarkers in early MASLD detection, enhancing predictive accuracy, and discerning responses to interventions (pharmacological or lifestyle modifications). Amid this discussion, the complexities of the relationship between T2D and MASLD are explored, considering factors like age, gender, genetics, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background. Biomarkers enhance the effectiveness of interventions and support global initiatives to reduce the burden of MASLD, thereby improving public health outcomes. This review recognizes the promising potential of biomarkers for diagnostic precision while candidly addressing the challenges in implementing these advancements in clinical practice. The transformative role of biomarkers emerges as a central theme, promising to reshape our understanding of disease trajectories, prognosis, and the customization of personalized therapeutic strategies for improved patient outcomes. From a future perspective, identifying early-stage biomarkers, understanding environmental impact through exposomes, and applying a multiomics approach may reveal additional insight into MASLD development.","Fariba Ahmadizar, Zobair M Younossi","Journal of clinical gastroenterology","2024Oct01",NA
"39351966","A meta-analysis and polygenic score study identifies novel genetic markers for waist-hip ratio in African populations.","Understanding the genetic underpinnings of anthropometric traits in diverse populations is crucial for gaining insights into their biological mechanisms and potential implications for health. We conducted a genome-wide association study, meta-analysis, and gene set analysis of waist-hip ratio (WHR), WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), waist circumference, BMI, and height using the African Collaborative Center for Microbiome and Genomics Research (ACCME) cohort (n = ~11,000) for discovery and polygenic score target analyses and the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study (n = ~5200) for replication and polygenic score validation. We generated and compared polygenic scores from European, African, Afro-Caribbean, and multiethnic ancestry populations. The top loci associated with each trait in the meta-analysis were in CD36 (rs3211826 [p = 5.90 × 10-12] for WHR and rs73709003 [p = 1.75 × 10-13] for WHRadjBMI), IFI27L1 (rs59775050 [p = 2.66 × 10-08] for waist circumference), INPP4B (rs2636629 [p = 1.44 × 10-09] for BMI), and HMGA1 (rs6937622 [p = 1.40 × 10-15] for height) gene regions. A novel variant rs7797157, near GNAT3, was also significantly associated with WHR (p = 2.50 × 10-10) and WHRadjBMI (p = 2.66 × 10-11). The ancestry-specific parameters for the best predictive polygenic scores were European ancestry (R2 = 0.68%; p = 1.63 × 10-16) and multiethnic ancestry (R2 = 0.06%; p = 1.29 × 10-02) for WHR; European ancestry (R2 = 1.36%; p = 2.94 × 10-31) and multiethnic ancestry (R2 = 1.12%; p = 3.52 × 10-25) for BMI; and European ancestry (R2 = 3.16%; p = 2.95 × 10-73), African ancestry (R2 = 4.16%; p = 1.75 × 10-96), and African and Afro-Caribbean ancestry (R2 = 2.67%; p = 4.35 × 10-62) for height. The discovery of a novel locus for WHR and genetic signals for each trait and the assessment of polygenic score performance underscore the importance of conducting well-powered studies in diverse populations.","Michael Zhong, Ebuka Onyenobi, Ayo Duomatey, Guanjie Chen, James Perry, Zhenyao Ye, NA NA, Charles Rotimi, Clement A Adebamowo, Adebowale Adeyemo, Sally N Adebamowo","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","2024Oct01",NA

This study was conducted to review clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for managing pregnancy following metabolic-bariatric surgery. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of all CPGs that covered the management of pregnancy following metabolic-bariatric surgery, 2010 through 2022, and that were published in English. Two authors independently scored the quality and usefulness of CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool (AGREE II). From a total of 20 CPGs, consistent recommendations included the following: 1) contraception with long-acting reversible contraceptives before surgery until the optimal time of pregnancy; 2) nutritional care by a dietitian; 3) considering gastrointestinal discomforts during pregnancy as a potential surgical complication; and 4) modified screening for gestational diabetes instead of glucose tolerance tests preventing post-bariatric hypoglycemia. There was a lack of uniformity concerning surgery-to-conception interval and dose of supplements, as well as research gaps regarding the surgical type, mental health, delivery type, breastfeeding, neonatal care, and weight retention. All recommendations for managing pregnancy after metabolic-bariatric surgery were deemed clinically useful.

"39351858","Socioeconomic and medical determinants of state-level subjective cognitive decline in the United States.","It is important to understand the socioeconomic and medical determinants of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at a population level in the United States. The primary outcomes are state-level rates of SCD and SCD-related functional impairment in adults aged ≥ 45, both measured in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2016 to 2022. The exposures are state-level rates of poverty, unemployment, homelessness, college education, racial and ethnic minorities, uninsurance, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity as well as household income and physician density. The strongest state-level associations with rates of SCD were the prevalence of diabetes (rho = 0.64), hypertension (rho = 0.59), and poverty (rho = 0.58; all p < 0.001), and with SCD-related functional impairment were prevalence of poverty (rho = 0.71), diabetes (rho = 0.68), and hypertension (rho = 0.53; all p < 0.001). This study highlights critical links between SCD and socioeconomic and medical determinants in adults aged ≥ 45 in the United States, including the prevalence of poverty, diabetes, and hypertension. State-level analysis reveals socioeconomic and medical risk factors for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at a population level. The prevalence of poverty is a critical contributor to the state-level prevalence of SCD. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension are also strong state-level determinants of SCD.

We hypothesized that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration would be associated with a decrease in AKI development in patients undergoing unilateral partial nephrectomy. In this retrospective study, adult patients who underwent unilateral partial nephrectomy from April 2016 to October 2023 were included. Exclusion criteria were a history of end-stage renal disease, ineligible procedures (i.e., aborted procedure, conversion to radical nephrectomy, surgery on a horseshoe kidney), and reoperation within three days of the initial nephrectomy. Patients were categorized according to whether they received intraoperative dexmedetomidine. The primary outcome was AKI incidence within three days of surgery; AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to account for potential confounders (age, body mass index, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, final surgical approach, clamping-related ischemia for >15 min). We included 1,632 patients; 214 received dexmedetomidine and 1,418 did not. Before PSM, the AKI rate was 31.2% in patients who received dexmedetomidine and 25.7% in patients who did not (p = 0.081). After PSM, the AKI rate was 31.3% in patients who received dexmedetomidine and 27.6% in those who did not (p = 0.396). The post-PSM odds ratio for AKI following dexmedetomidine administration during unilateral partial nephrectomy was 0.910 (95% CI: 0.585-1.142; p = 0.677).

"39351780","Exposure to aircraft noise exacerbates cardiovascular and oxidative damage in three mouse models of diabetes.","Epidemiology links noise to increased risk of metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity. Translational studies in humans and experimental animals showed that noise causes reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cardiovascular damage. The interaction between noise and diabetes, specifically potential additive adverse effects, remains to be determined. C57BL/6 mice were treated with streptozotocin (i.p. injections, 50 mg/kg/d for 5d) to induce type-1 diabetes, with S961 (subcutaneous osmotic minipumps, 0.57 mg/kg/d for 7d) or fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 20 weeks) to induce type-2 diabetes. Control and diabetic mice were exposed to aircraft noise to an average sound pressure level of 72 dB(A) for 4d. While body weight was unaffected, noise reduced insulin production in all diabetes models. The oral glucose tolerance test showed only an additive aggravation by noise in the HFD model. Noise increased blood pressure and aggravated diabetes-induced aortic, mesenteric, and cerebral arterioles endothelial dysfunction. ROS formation in cerebral arterioles, the aorta, the heart, and isolated mitochondria was consistently increased by noise in all models of diabetes. Mitochondrial respiration was impaired by diabetes and noise, however without additive effects. Noise increased ROS and caused inflammation in adipose tissue in the HFD model. RNA sequencing data and alteration of gene pathway clusters also supported additive damage by noise in the setting of diabetes. In all three models of diabetes, aircraft noise exacerbates oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in mice with pre-existing diabetes. Thus, noise may potentiate the already increased cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.","Dominika Mihalikova, Paul Stamm, Miroslava Kvandova, Chinmayi Pednekar, Lea Strohm, Henning Ubbens, Matthias Oelze, Marin Kuntic, Claudius Witzler, Maria Teresa Bayo Jimenez, Sanela Rajlic, Katie Frenis, Qi Tang, Yue Ruan, Susanne Karbach, Hartmut Kleinert, Omar Hahad, Alex von Kriegsheim, Ning Xia, Tilman Grune, Huige Li, Swenja Kröller-Schön, Adrian Gericke, Wolfram Ruf, Philipp S Wild, Philipp Lurz, Thomas Münzel, Andreas Daiber, Thomas Jansen","European journal of preventive cardiology","2024Oct01",NA

The study involved 50 participants diagnosed with NAFLD and 50 healthy controls. Blood samples were collected to measure vitamin A, C and E levels, along with other parameters like insulin, inflammatory markers, and liver function tests. Additionally, participants underwent DEXA scans to assess BMD and body composition. Vitamin levels: The study found no significant deficiencies in vitamin A or C levels in either group. However, vitamin E levels were significantly higher in the NAFLD group compared to controls, although only one case of vitamin E deficiency was observed in the NAFLD group. No significant correlations were found between vitamin levels and BMD, adiposity parameters, insulin resistance, or subclinical inflammation markers in either group. The study acknowledges the limited data available on the association between NAFLD, vitamin levels and BMD in the Asian Indian population. The findings regarding vitamin A and C levels are consistent with some previous studies, whereas the higher vitamin E levels in the NAFLD group contradict other research. This discrepancy might be due to factors like sample size, dietary habits, or vitamin fortification programs. The lack of significant correlations between vitamin levels and other parameters suggests that further research is needed to understand the complex interplay between these factors in NAFLD development and progression.","S Mondithoka, N K Vikram, P Ranjan, M Pandey, A Seth, R Lakshmy, D Javed, V Malhotra","Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ","2024Oct","Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Vitamin E; Male; Vitamin A; Female; Adult; India; Middle Aged; Ascorbic Acid; Cohort Studies; Bone Density; Insulin Resistance; Case-Control Studies"

"39351710","Comparison of serum Alanine Aminotransferase and Aspartate Aminotransferase among Obese and Non-obese Adults.","Obesity is a major global health issue and WHO points out that 1 in 3 people globally is clinically obese. Obesity is a condition of having an excessive amount of body fat and is linked with several health disorders that include metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases as well as liver diseases. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually used to assess liver function. It is established that obesity results in many cases of liver disorders known as steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is the excessive deposit of fat within the liver cells that may result in inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Studies on obesity have established that obese subjects significantly tend to have higher liver enzymes like ALT and AST than non-obese adults. This study aims to compare these two liver enzymes between these two groups in the hopes of shedding light on how obesity impacts the liver and offers these biomarkers for NAFLD. The study was designed to assess the status of liver function in adult obese individuals by examining key markers, including serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), and to compare them with non-obese adults. The present cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology and Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, from Octy 2023 to June 2024. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. A total of 200 participants took part in this study. Out of them, 100 were selected as case (obese adults) and another 100 non-obese adults were selected as control. In this study, serum ALT and AST levels were measured for analytical study. All the values were expressed as mean±SD. Statistical analysis was done using by using SPSS Windows package version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was calculated using Student's unpaired 't'- test. Pearson's correlation is done to see the level of significance. After careful evaluation, the mean±SD values of serum ALT were 37.14±15.18 U/L and 21.92±5.10 U/L in case and control groups respectively, and mean±SD values of serum AST were 41.15±15.24 U/L and 25.01±6.65 U/L in case and control group respectively.

"39351689","Association of hypertension and long-term blood pressure changes with new-onset diabetes in the elderly: A 10-year cohort study.","To explore the correlation between new-onset diabetes (NOD), hypertension and blood pressure management among elderly individuals in China. A cohort analysis involved 1380 participants aged 60 years or older, initially free of diabetes in 2008, from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Follow-up assessments occurred every 2-3 years. The relationship between hypertension, blood pressure changes and NOD was analysed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression. By 2018, 102 participants developed diabetes, while 1278 remained without diabetes. The cumulative diabetes prevalence increased from 3.1% at 3 years to 7.4% at 10 years. Hypertension prevalence increased from 20.9% at baseline to 41.0% at 10 years, with higher rates in those diagnosed with diabetes during follow-up. Multivariate analysis identified age, gender, baseline hypertension and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as independent predictors of NOD. Hypertension combined with overweight/obesity significantly increased the risk of NOD (hazard ratio [HR] 2.837; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.680-4.792). We evaluated participants' blood pressure management levels in 2008 and 2011, then tracked the onset of diabetes from 2011 to 2018. Compared with participants with an average SBP below 120 mmHg in 2008 and 2011, those with SBP of 140 mmHg or higher had an 8-fold higher risk of developing NOD (adjusted HR8.492, 95% CI 2.048-35.217, P = .003), the highest risk group. Participants with SBP of 130-139.9 mmHg also had a significantly increased risk (adjusted HR 5.065, 95% CI 1.186-21.633, P = .029), while those with SBP of 120-129.9 mmHg showed no significant difference (HR 2.730, 95% CI 0.597-12.481, P = .195). Consistently high SBP (≥ 130 mmHg) further increased NOD risk (adjusted HR 3.464, 95% CI 1.464-8.196, P = .005). Significant predictors of NOD included age, gender, baseline hypertension and blood pressure management. Maintaining SBP consistently below 130 mmHg may be an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of NOD in the general elderly population.","Shanshan Li, Boyi Yang, Shasha Shang, Wei Jiang","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","2024Oct01",NA
"39351534","Genetic support of causal association between lipid and glucose metabolism and stress urinary incontinence in women: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization and multivariable-adjusted study.","Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition characterized by urethral sphincter failure and urine leakage. Its prevalence in women is higher than in men, and estimates of crude prevalence rates vary widely due to factors such as research methodologies, study populations, and underreporting by patients. This variability hinders research and impacts patient diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life. The complex etiology of SUI is not fully understood, and previous studies have primarily focused on non-invasive indicators. While emerging observational research suggests a correlation between SUI in women and abnormalities in lipid and blood metabolism, the underlying biological mechanisms and causal relationships require further investigation. This study aims to explore the causalities between SUI in women and lipid and blood metabolism. Using bidirectional univariate Mendelian randomization (MR), we investigated the causal association between SUI liability in women (case/control = 5,924/399,509) from UK Biobank and lipid and glucose metabolism, indicated by total cholesterol (TC, N = 61,166), low-density lipoproteins (LDL, N = 58,381), high-density lipoproteins (HDL, N = 60,812), triglycerides (TG, N = 60,027), fasting glucose (FG, N = 19,745), and fasting insulin (FI, N = 38,238) from ENGAGE consortium. To account for potential confounding effects, multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses were performed, adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and separately among lipid and glucose metabolism. We found that increased genetically proxied TC, LDL, and HDL levels were associated with an elevated risk of SUI in women (OR: 1.090-1.117, all P < 0.05), These associations were further supported by MVMR analyses with adjustment for BMI (OR: 1.087-1.114, all P < 0.05). Conversely, increased FG and FI were associated with reduced SUI reliability in women (OR: 0.731-0.815, all P < 0.05). When adjusting among lipid and glucose metabolism, only HDL and FI demonstrated causal effects. Reverse MR analyses provided no genetic evidence supporting the causal effect of SUI in women on lipid and blood metabolism (all P > 0.05). Our results reported that increased TC, LDL, and HDL are linked to higher SUI susceptibility in women, while higher FG and FI levels have a protective effect. In overweight/obese women with metabolic abnormalities, the positive associations between TC, LDL, and HDL levels and SUI indicate a higher risk.","Nanyan Xiang, Shiqi Su, Yong Yang, Yurui Luo, Tingting Fu, Le Wang, Yifei Lin, Jin Huang","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Female; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Lipid Metabolism; Blood Glucose; Case-Control Studies; Aged; Adult; Lipids; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Glucose"
"39351515","Contribution of extracellular vesicles to steatosis-related liver disease and their therapeutic potential.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small particles released by many cell types in different tissues, including the liver, and transfer specific cargo molecules from originating cells to receptor cells. This process generally culminates in activation of distant cells and inflammation and progression of certain diseases. The global chronic liver disease (CLD) epidemic is estimated at 1.5 billion patients worldwide. Cirrhosis and liver cancer are the most common risk factors for CLD.

"39351474","Impact of hypertension and lipid profile on cardiac function in an Iranian teaching hospital: A cross-sectional analysis.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a significant global health challenge and affect diverse populations. For conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke prevalence, understanding the multifaceted factors contributing to CVDs is crucial. Hypertension and dyslipidemia, which are established risk factors, require further exploration, particularly in terms of their individual impact on cardiac function. This study aims to uncover associations, elucidate nuanced interplay, and provide insights for personalized interventions. A cross-sectional analysis, conducted at a Tehran Teaching Hospital, focused on adults admitted for suspected heart disease. The dataset included demographic information, clinical history, medications, and echocardiographic data. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation with IBM SPSS Statistics software. In this analysis of 95 individuals suspected of heart disease, aged 51 years on average, diverse blood pressure patterns with significant percentages across various hypertension stages were observed. Lipid profile analysis revealed typical lipid levels. Correlations between blood pressure, lipid parameters, and cardiac function indicated significant associations, including a negative correlation between ejection fraction and blood pressure and significant correlations between lipid profiles and adverse cardiac volume changes. Disparities in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes have highlighted potential links to hypertension. This study sheds light on crucial clinical aspects of individuals with suspected heart disease, revealing patterns of obesity, varied blood pressure categories, and nuanced lipid profiles. The correlations between blood pressure, lipid parameters, and cardiac function highlight potential connections, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions for improved cardiovascular outcomes.","Fatemeh Omidi, Mohammad Javad Nasiri, Soheila Sadeghi","Global cardiology science & practice","2024Aug01",NA
"39351469","SELECT: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in obese patients with cardiovascular disease in the absence of diabetes.","Obesity is a global epidemic affecting 2.5 billion people and is recognized as the fourth leading cause of global mortality. Obesity is characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat and is associated with a range of health consequences, including an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been proven to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. Study and results: The SELECT trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven superiority trial, conducted at 804 clinical sites in 41 countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo. The primary cardiovascular efficacy endpoint was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. A total of 17,604 patients were recruited, with a mean age of 61.6 years and 72.3% males. The mean duration of exposure to semaglutide or placebo in the overall trial population was 34.2 ± 13.7 months. The primary CVD endpoint occurred in 6.5% (n = 569) of the semaglutide group and 8% (n = 701) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.90; P < 0.001). There was also a significant reduction of 9.39% in body weight among the patients taking semaglutide over 104 weeks after randomization versus 0.88% among the placebo group. Semaglutide reduces the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in obese and overweight non-diabetic patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease.","Susy Kotit, Marina Sous","Global cardiology science & practice","2024Aug01",NA
"39351353","Testing home-based exercise strategies in underserved minority cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (THRIVE) trial: a study protocol.","Higher rates of physical inactivity and comorbid conditions are reported in Hispanic/Latinx and Black cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared to their White counterparts. Despite the beneficial effect of exercise training for cancer patients, rates of participation in exercise oncology clinical trials are low among disadvantaged and racial and ethnic minority groups. Here, we will examine the effect of an exercise intervention using a novel, accessible, and cost-effective home-based exercise approach among Hispanic/Latinx and Black cancer patients receiving chemotherapy on exercise participation and cardiovascular disease risk. The THRIVE trial is an 8-month prospective, three-arm study of 45 patients who are randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to a supervised exercise intervention (SUP), unsupervised exercise (UNSUP), or an attention control (AC) group. Eligible patients include those with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer, who are sedentary, overweight or obese, self-identify as Hispanic/Latinx or Black, and plan to receive chemotherapy. Patients randomized to the SUP group participate in a home-based 16-week periodized aerobic and resistance exercise program performed three days per week, supervised through video conference technology. Patients randomized to the UNSUP group participate in an unsupervised 16-week, telehealth-based, periodized aerobic and resistance exercise program performed three days per week using the same exercise prescription parameters as the SUP group. Patients randomized to the AC group receive a 16-week home-based stretching program. The primary outcome is changes in minutes of physical activity assessed by 7-day accelerometry at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular risk factors, patient-reported outcomes, and physical function. Outcome measures are tested at baseline, post-intervention at month 4, and after a non-intervention follow-up period at month 8. The THRIVE trial is the first study to employ a novel and potentially achievable exercise intervention for a minority population receiving chemotherapy. In addition, this study utilizes an intervention approach to investigate the biological and behavioral mechanisms underlying exercise participation in these cancer patients.

"39351345","Association of breastfeeding duration with overweight and obesity among women in Ghana.","There is a general concurrence on the health benefits that breastfeeding confers to children, including offering maximal protection against obesity across their life course. However, the scientific evidence on similar benefits for women who breastfeed their children remains inconclusive. This study contributes to the discourse by examining the association of breastfeeding duration with overweight and obesity among women in Ghana. Data on 8,516 women of reproductive age were pooled from the last five (5) Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys, and analysed using descriptive proportions and logistic regression models. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was about 8% lower for women who breastfed their children beyond 18 months (overweight = 13%, obesity = 5%) compared with women who did not breastfeed (overweight = 21%, obesity = 13%) their children at all. With reference to women who did not breastfeed their children, a significant lower odds of obesity was observed for those who breastfed their children for 13-18 months (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.268, 0.864) and >18 months (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.216, 0.764), after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Women who breastfeed their children for a minimum of 12 months have lower risk of developing obesity.

The definition of hypertension was a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or a current treatment plan with an antihypertensive medication. High blood pressure (HBP) included the following subtypes: SDH, ISH and IDH. All participants were interviewed, had physical examinations performed, and had blood pressure measurements taken. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to analyse the risk factors for hypertension. The prevalence of HBP was 43.2 %. The subtype-specific prevalence of hypertension was 16.5 % for SDH, 24.2 % for ISH and 2.5 % for IDH. Among hypertensive participants, 38.2 % were SDH, 56.0 % were ISH and 5.8 % were IDH. Older age is a risk factor for HBP and ISH. Obesity, smoking, drinking and history of hypertension are risk factors for HBP and its subtypes including SDH and ISH (OR >1). Among all the hypertensive participants, only 25.0 % of the participants were aware of their hypertension while 34.7 % of SDH participants, 20.0 % of ISH participants and 9.3 % of IDH participants knew the individual subtype of hypertension. Among Dai people, the prevalence of hypertension is high, while the awareness and the rate of adequate treatment of hypertension is low. ISH stood out as the most prevalent type of HBP among the rural elderly.

"39351265","The current epidemiology of vascular injuries associated with knee dislocation in the United States from 2010 to 2022.","Despite the recognized importance of managing vascular injury associated with knee dislocation, studies have been limited by small patient sizes, data older than five years, and lack of inclusion of newer procedural and diagnoses codes. This has been reflected in the reported frequency of knee dislocation associated with vascular injury ranging from 1.6 % to 64 %. As such, we sought to determine: (1) the frequency of knee dislocations associated with vascular injuries; (2) the frequency of knee dislocations associated with vascular injuries that required repair; as well as (3) independent risk factors for knee dislocation with vascular injury that require repair, across different age groups, sexes, and United States geographic regions. A national, all-payer database was queried from January 1, 2010 to June 31, 2022. The frequency of a vascular injury was calculated by dividing the number of vascular injuries within 30 days of all knee dislocations by the total number of knee dislocations in each category. The frequency of a vascular injury that required repair was calculated by dividing the number of vascular injuries that required repair associated with knee dislocation by the total number of vascular injuries associated with knee dislocations. Patients were categorized by year of diagnosis, age, sex, and US geographic region. Multivariable logistic regressions were calculated to determine independent risk factors for knee dislocation with vascular injury. From 2010 to 2022, there were 99,688 knee dislocations. Of the total knee dislocations, there were 1066 (1.1 %) vascular injuries associated with knee dislocations, 96,530 (96.8 %) were closed dislocations, and 3158 (2.2 %) were open dislocations. Of the 1066 vascular injuries associated with knee dislocations, 262 (24.6 %) vascular injuries required repair. Male sex (P < 0.001), Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) > 3 (P < 0.001), alcohol abuse (P = 0.006), congestive heart failure (P = 0.01), hypothyroidism (P = 0.003), and obesity (P < 0.001), were independent risk factors for knee dislocation with vascular injuries. Our study provides a refined understanding of the historically low incidence of knee dislocation with vascular injury as well as an increase in vascular injuries requiring repair from 2010 to 2022. Given the large expense of irreversible injury in these patients, vulnerable patient populations identified in our study, such as obese patients with additional comorbidities, should be a focus of future intervention. These findings can guide physicians in a clinical setting to appropriately manage the expectations of patients as well as minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with this presentation.","Jeremy A Dubin, Sandeep S Bains, Ethan Remily, Hytham Salem, Oliver Sax, Daniel Hameed, James Nace, Philip K McClure, Ronald E Delanois","Journal of orthopaedics","2025Jan",NA
"39351190","Artificial Intelligence in Identifying Patients With Undiagnosed Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.","Background: Although increasing in prevalence, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is often undiagnosed in clinical practice. Objective: This study identified patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system who likely had undiagnosed NASH using a machine learning algorithm. Methods: From a VA data set of 25 million adult enrollees, the study population was divided into NASH-positive, non-NASH, and at-risk cohorts. We performed a claims data analysis using a machine learning algorithm. To build our model, the study population was randomly divided into an 80% training subset and a 20% testing subset and tested and trained using a cross-validation technique. In addition to the baseline model, a gradient-boosted classification tree, naïve Bayes, and random forest model were created and compared using receiver operator characteristics, area under the curve, and accuracy. The best performing model was retrained on the full 80% training subset and applied to the 20% testing subset to calculate the performance metrics. Results: In total, 4 223 443 patients met the study inclusion criteria, of whom 4903 were positive for NASH and 35 528 were non-NASH patients. The remainder was in the at-risk patient cohort, of which 514 997 patients (12%) were identified as likely to have NASH. Age, obesity, and abnormal liver function tests were the top determinants in assigning NASH probability. Conclusions: Utilization of machine learning to predict NASH allows for wider recognition, timely intervention, and targeted treatments to improve or mitigate disease progression and could be used as an initial screening tool.","Onur Baser, Gabriela Samayoa, Nehir Yapar, Erdem Baser","Journal of health economics and outcomes research","2024",NA

However, the causal relationship between COPD and CVDs and the reverse causality remains divergent. Exposure and outcome data from the largest available genome-wide association studies were extracted for Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Univariate MR analysis was performed using IVW as the primary analysis method, and multiple sensitivity analyses were used to enhance the robustness of the results. Furthermore, this was followed by mediation MR analysis of positive results after excluding confounding factors with multivariable MR analysis. The MR estimation based on IVW method indicated a strong association between genetically determined COPD and heart failure (HF) (OR = 1.117, 95% CI: 1.066-1.170, p <0.001), coronary heart disease (CHD) (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006, p <0.001), essential hypertension (EH) (OR = 1.009, 95% CI: 1.005-1.013, p <0.001) as well as Stroke (OR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.001-1.004, p <0.001). The results of multivariable MR analysis revealed that COPD is not significantly associated with CHD after adjusting for IL-6, LDL, or total cholesterol (p>0.05). Our findings indicated that BMI, smoking initiation, smoking status, obesity, and FEV1 played a role in the causal effect of COPD on HF, EH, and Stroke. We found positive causal relationships between COPD and HF, EH, and Stroke essentially unaffected by other confounding factors. The causal relationship exhibited between COPD and CHD was influenced by confounding factors. BMI, obesity, initiation of smoking, smoking status, and FEV1 were the mediators between COPD and CVDs.","Guangzan Yu, Lulu Liu, Qian Ma, Fusheng Han, Hua He","International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","2024","Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Phenotype; Mediation Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Lung; Smoking"

Clinical complications and outcomes associated with HTG-AP are generally more severe than those seen in AP caused by other etiologies. HTG-AP is closely linked to metabolic dysfunction and frequently coexists with metabolic syndrome or its components. However, the impact of metabolic syndrome components on HTG-AP clinical outcomes remains unclear. To investigate the impact of metabolic syndrome component burden on clinical outcomes in HTG-AP. In this retrospective study of 255 patients diagnosed with HTG-AP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, we collected data on patient demographics, clinical scores, complications, and clinical outcomes. Subsequently, we analyzed the influence of the presence and number of individual metabolic syndrome components, including obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), on the aforementioned parameters in HTG-AP patients. This study found that metabolic syndrome components were associated with an increased risk of various complications in HTG-AP, with low HDL-C being the most significant risk factor for clinical outcomes. The risk of complications increased with the number of metabolic syndrome components. Adjusted for age and sex, patients with high-component metabolic syndrome had significantly higher risks of renal failure [odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, 95%CI: 1.12-8.11)], SAP (OR = 5.05, 95%CI: 2.04-12.49), and intensive care unit admission (OR = 6.41, 95%CI: 2.42-16.97) compared to those without metabolic syndrome.

"39351029","Economic evaluation of the prevention of falls resulting from missed care in polish hospitals.","Falls are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization and an increase in the cost of treatment in hospitals. They contribute to the deterioration of fitness and quality of life, especially among older patients, thus posing a serious social and economic problem. They increase the risk of premature death. Falls are adverse, costly, and potentially preventable. The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of avoiding one fall by nurse care provided by the nurses with higher education, from the perspective of the health service provider. The economic analysis included and compared only the cost of nurse intervention measured by the hours of care provided with higher education in non-surgical departments (40.5%) with higher time spend by nurses with higher education level an increase in the number of hours by 10% (50.5%) to avoid one fall. The time horizon for the study is 1 year (2021). Cost-effectiveness and Cost-benefit analysis were performed. All registered falls of all hospitalized patients were included in the study. In the analyzed was based on the case control study where, 7,305 patients were hospitalized, which amounted to 41,762 patient care days. Care was provided by 100 nurses, including 40 nurses with bachelor's degrees and nurses with Master of Science in Nursing. Increasing the hours number of high-educated nurses care by 10% in non-surgical departments decreased the chance for falls by 9%; however, this dependence was statistically insignificant (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.72-1.65; p = 0.65). After the intervention (a 10% increase in Bachelor's Degrees/Master of Science in Nursing hours), the number of additional Bachelor's Degrees/Master of Science hours was 6100.5, and the cost was USD 7630.4. The intervention eliminated four falls. The cost of preventing one fall is CER = USD 1697.1. The results of these studies broaden the understanding of the relationship among nursing education, falls, and the economic outcomes of hospital care.

Systemic inflammation is postulated as a crucial mechanism, yet there are few studies examining this at the earliest stages prior to overt cognitive impairment. To assess this, we recruited a cohort of middle-aged cognitively-unimpaired individuals with and without uncomplicated T2DM. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline and at 4-year follow-up. Ten serum chemokines and cytokines (Eotaxin, MCP-1, MIP-1β, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10, IL12p70, IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF-α) were measured at both baseline and follow-up using high-sensitivity assays. Overall, 136 participants were recruited including 90 with uncomplicated midlife T2DM (age 52.6 ± 8.3; 47% female) and 46 without (age 52.9 ± 8.03; 61% female). Cognitive trajectories were stable over time and did not differ with T2DM. Yet on cross-sectional analyses at both baseline and follow-up, greater circulating IL-17A was consistently associated with poorer performance on tests of executive function/attention (β: 0.21; -0.40, -0.02, p = 0.03 at baseline; β: 0.26; -0.46, -0.05, p = 0.02 at follow-up). Associations persisted on covariate adjustment and did not differ by T2DM status. In summary, we provide evidence that greater circulating IL-17A levels were associated with poorer executive function in midlife, independent of T2DM. Long-term follow-up of this and other cohorts will further elucidate the earliest stages in the relationship between systemic inflammation and cognitive decline to provide further mechanistic insights and potentially identify those at greatest risk for later cognitive decline.","Laura Morrison, Adam H Dyer, Helena Dolphin, Isabella Batten, Conor Reddy, Matthew Widdowson, Conor P Woods, James Gibney, Nollaig M Bourke, Sean P Kennelly","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health","2024Nov",NA

Compared to the general population, the incidence of MAFLD is notably higher among pregnant women, posing potential risks to both maternal and neonatal health. This review summarizes the latest research on MAFLD, focusing on its association with pregnancy complications. Additionally, it provides a comparative analysis with previous studies on NAFLD, presenting a comprehensive perspective for clinical management. Findings suggest that pregnant women with MAFLD face a higher risk of gestational hypertension and cesarean delivery compared to those with NAFLD, while the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus remains similar between the two conditions. Additionally, MAFLD is associated with an increased likelihood of delivering large-for-gestational-age infants and heightened risks of preterm birth and low birth weight. Current treatment strategies for MAFLD focus on lifestyle modifications, such as dietary adjustments and increased physical activity. However, there is an urgent need for the development of safe and effective pharmacological treatments, particularly tailored toward pregnant women. Future research should delve deeper into the causal relationships between MAFLD and pregnancy complications and explore optimal therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for mothers and their infants.","Yang Zhang, Yifan Bu, Rui Zhao, Cheng Han","Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism","2024",NA

Likewise, gallbladder necrosis is a complication of cholecystitis associated with higher risks of morbidity and mortality. Identification of risk factors which portend to gallbladder necrosis is key in prioritizing the management of higher-risk patients. This study aimed to identify such factors that predict the development of gallbladder necrosis. Method A retrospective review of all patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy in a tertiary hospital over a two-year period was performed. Gallbladder necrosis was diagnosed on histopathological examination of operative specimens. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine risk factors for gallbladder necrosis. Results A total of 163 patients underwent acute cholecystectomy and 43 (26%) had proven gallbladder necrosis. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that elevated white cell count (WCC) (OR 1.122, 95%CI 1.031-1.221, p=0.007), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.004, 95%CI 1.001-1.008, p=0.022) and positive smoking status (OR 5.724, 95%CI 1.323-24.754, p=0.020) were independently predictive of gallbladder necrosis. Notably, advancing age, elevated BMI, diabetes mellitus or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade were not found to be associated with developing necrosis. Conclusion Patients at risk of gallbladder necrosis include those with higher WCC, CRP, and active smokers. Given the increased potential complications, these risk factors should be identified early in the management of those admitted with gallstone disease to ensure such patients receive aggressive medical therapy alongside timely and guided surgical intervention.","Sandeep Maharajh, Joshua Brown, Jakub Chmelo, Pooja Prasad, Alexander W Phillips","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

Contrarily, concerns have been raised about GLP-1R agonists increasing the risk of particular cancers. Recently, several epidemiological studies reported contradictory findings of incretin-based therapy on the risk modification for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The first cohort study demonstrated that incretin-based therapy was associated with an increased risk of CCA. Later studies, however, showed a null effect of incretin-based therapy on CCA risk for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor nor GLP-1R agonist. Mechanistically, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor is multifunctional, including promoting cell growth. High GLP-1R expressions were associated with progressive phenotypes of CCA cells in vitro. Unexpectedly, the GLP-1R agonist showed anti-tumor effects on CCA cells in vitro and in vivo with unclear mechanisms. Our recent report also showed that GLP-1R agonists suppressed the expression of GLP-1R in CCA cells in vitro and in vivo, leading to the inhibition of CCA tumor growth. This editorial reviews recent evidence, discusses the potential effects of GLP-1R agonists in CCA patients, and proposes underlying mechanisms that would benefit from further basic and clinical investigation.","Ronnakrit Trakoonsenathong, Ching-Feng Chiu, Charupong Saengboonmee","World journal of gastroenterology","2024Sep14","Cholangiocarcinoma; Humans; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Incretins; Cell Proliferation; Hypoglycemic Agents; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Agents; Animals"

In this case-control study, 120 participants were enrolled in four groups; Healthy people, newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, and enalapril- and candesartan-treated patients. Serum apelin levels were significantly lower and visfatin levels were significantly higher in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients compared with the control group (p=0.0015, p=0.0175 respectively). Moreover, apelin levels were higher and visfatin levels were lower in the candesartan-treated patients compared with the newly diagnosed group (p=0.0487, p<0.0001 respectively). Interestingly, apelin levels were non-significantly higher and visfatin levels were significantly lower in enalapril-treated patients compared with the newly diagnosed group (p<0.0001). Lower apelin and higher visfatin levels are associated with newly diagnosed patients with hypertension. Interestingly, the findings suggest that ACE inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade by enalapril and candesartan, respectively, positively regulate apelin and visfatin levels in hypertension. Specifically, candesartan regulates these adipokine to a greater extent than enalapril.","Yaseen K Jumaah, Zainab H Fathi, Jehan A Mohammad","Medeniyet medical journal","2024Sep30",NA
"39350530","Relationships between social determinants of health and healthy body composition among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth in the Next Generation: Youth Well-being study.","Little is currently known about the relationships between body composition and the social determinants of health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth in Australia, which could help inform policy responses to address health inequities. This study aimed to explore the relationship between various social factors and healthy body mass index (BMI) and waist/height ratio (WHtR) among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth aged 16-24 years. Baseline survey data from 531 participants of the 'Next Generation: Youth Well-being study' were used. Robust Poisson regression quantified associations between healthy body composition and self-reported individual social factors (education, employment and income, government income support, food insecurity, home environment, relationship status, racism), family factors (caregiver education and employment) and area-level factors (remoteness, socioeconomic status). Healthy body composition was less common among those living in a crowded home (healthy WHtR aPR 0.67 [0.47-0.96]) and those receiving government income support (healthy BMI aPR 0.74 [0.57-0.95]). It was more common among those with tertiary educated caregivers (healthy BMI aPR 1.84 [1.30-2.61]; healthy WHtR aPR 1.41 [1.05-1.91]) and those in a serious relationship (healthy BMI aPR 1.33 [1.02-1.75]). Social factors at the individual and family level are associated with healthy body composition among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth.

"39350474","Prediction of Renal Graft Function 1 Year After Adult Deceased-Donor Kidney Transplantation Using Variables Available Prior to Transplantation.","BACKGROUND Kidney transplantation is still the best therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease, but the demand for donor organs persistently surpasses the supply. A prognostic model using pre-transplant data for the prediction of renal graft function would be helpful to optimize organ allocation and avoid futile transplantations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective data of 2431 patients who underwent kidney transplantation between January 01, 2000, and December 31, 2012 with subsequent ten-year clinical follow-up in our transplant center were analyzed. Of these, 1172 patients met the inclusion criteria. Multivariable regression modelling was used to develop a prognostic model for the prediction of graft function after 1 year utilizing only pre-transplant data. The final model was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. RESULTS Donor age, donor serum creatinine, recipient body mass index, re-transplantations beyond the second kidney transplantation, and cold ischemia time had an independent, significant influence on graded renal graft function 1 year after kidney transplantation. AUROC analysis of the prognostic model was >0.700 for all GFR categories except KDIGO G5, indicating high sensitivity and specificity of prediction. CONCLUSIONS For improvement of renal graft function, organs from older donors or donors with high serum creatinine should not be used in obese recipients and for re-transplantations beyond the second one. Cold ischemia time should be as short as possible.","Ulrich Zwirner, Dennis Kleine-Döpke, Alexander Wagner, Simon Störzer, Felix Gronau, Oliver Beetz, Nicolas Richter, Wilfried Gwinner, Ulf Kulik, Moritz Schmelzle, Harald Schrem","Annals of transplantation","2024Oct01","Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adult; Retrospective Studies; Prognosis; Graft Survival; Tissue Donors; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Cold Ischemia; Creatinine"

We used data from a cohort of pregnant individuals with overweight or obesity (n = 116). At 9-15 and 30-36 weeks gestation, waking movement was measured using wrist-worn accelerometers and sleep duration was self-reported. Outcomes were obtained from delivery electronic health records (birth) and study visits (12 months). We used compositional isotemporal substitution models. In early pregnancy, reallocating 10 minutes of sleep, sedentary behavior, or LPA to MVPA was associated with 20% (RR = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.75,0.85), 21% (RR = 0.79; 95%CI: 0.75,0.84), and 25% (RR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.70,0.81) lower risk of large-for-gestational age (LGA) birthweight, respectively, and 17% (RR = 0.83; 95%CI: 0.75,0.91), 18% (RR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.75,0.91), and 22% (RR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.70,0.88) lower risk of rapid infant growth (birth to 12 months), respectively. In late pregnancy, reallocating 10 minutes to MVPA was associated with 18% to 22% lower risk of LGA birthweight, but was not associated with rapid infant growth. Reallocating time to MVPA in early or late pregnancy was not associated with high newborn body fat percent. Our findings suggest beneficial associations of theoretically reallocating time from sleep, sedentary behavior, or LPA to MVPA, especially during early pregnancy, for reducing LGA birthweight and rapid infant growth.","Sylvia E Badon, Assiamira Ferrara, Kelley Pettee Gabriel, Erin E Dooley, Charles P Quesenberry, Lyndsay A Avalos, Monique M Hedderson","Medicine and science in sports and exercise","2024Oct01",NA

Furthermore, sleep disturbances, an emerging factor, has not been incorporated into the life-course model of dementia prevention. To estimate the population impact of 12 modifiable risk factors in Canadian adults including sleep disturbances, by sex and age groups, and to compare with other countries. Cross-sectional analysis of Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging baseline data. Community. 30,097 adults aged 45 years and older. Prevalence and Population Attributable Fractions (PAFs) associated with less education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and sleep disturbances. The risk factors with the largest PAF were later life physical inactivity (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 13%), midlife hearing loss (6.5%; 3.7% to 9.3%), midlife obesity (6.4%; 4.1% to 7.7%), and midlife hypertension (6.2%; 2.7% to 9.3%). The PAF of later life sleep disturbances was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.8% to 3.8%). The 12 risk factors accounted for 51.9% (32.2% to 68.0%) of dementia among men and 52.4% (32.5% to 68.7%) among women. Overall, the combined PAF of all risk factors was 49.2% (31.1% to 64.9%), and it increased with age. Nearly up to 50% of dementia cases in Canada are attributable to 12 modifiable risk factors across the lifespan.

Prospective cohort study. The group-based trajectory modeling and Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to explore the association between cognitive trajectory groups and mortality, while multinomial logistic regression models were constructed to estimate potential risk factors. We included 7082 participants aged 65 years or above in three consecutive but non-overlapping cohorts of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey with the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination up to 6 years. Participants were subsequently followed for a median (IQR) of 2.89 (1.38-3.12) years to obtain their survival status and date of death. Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination was used to measure participants' cognitive function. Through use of group-based trajectory modeling, we determined three cognitive trajectory groups. Then, after adjusting for confounding factors, we found a monotonic and positive association between cognitive decline and mortality risk. Meanwhile, the association varied among elderly populations in different age groups and BMI categories, but did not differ by sex, smoking, drinking and exercising. Older seniors, females and those with poorer baseline cognitive function and less social participation tended to be more likely to be in the unfavorable trajectory groups. We found that the faster the cognitive decline, the higher the mortality, especially among those aged 65-79 years and those overweight. Our findings suggested the importance of implement better monitoring of the cognitive function of the elderly population.","Y Zhao, W Zhou, M Xing, L Zhang, Y Tong, X Lv, Y Ma, W Li","The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease","2024","Humans; Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; China; Risk Factors; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Cognition"

The objective of this study is to assess the effect of body mass index (BMI) on ablation-induced scar formation on late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMR). We conducted an analysis of DECAAF II participants who underwent LGE-CMR scans to measure scar formation 3 months after catheter ablation. Ablation parameters and lesion delivery were not dependent on BMI. The effect of BMI on ablation success was explored. Our analyses included 811 patients. Comorbidities were more prevalent in obese patients. Baseline left atrial volume was higher in obese individuals, 118, 126, 135, 140, and 143 mm3 for normal weight, overweight, obese grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < .001). BMI was associated with scar formation (R = -0.135, p < .001), with patients with Class 3 obesity having the lowest percentage of ablation-induced scar, 11.1%, 10.3%, 9.5%, 8.8%, 6.8% by ascending BMI group. There was an inverse correlation between BMI and the amount of fibrosis covered by ablation scar, 24%, 23%, 21%, and 18% by ascending BMI group (p = .001). For the fibrosis-guided ablation group, BMI was associated with residual fibrosis (R = 0.056, p = .005).

"39350353","Longitudinal Associations of Aerobic Activity, Muscle-Strengthening Activity, and Adiposity with Cardiorespiratory Fitness.","Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) declines with age, and greater declines increase the risk for adverse health outcomes. Understanding factors that attenuate age-related decreases in CRF can help extend healthy life. We sought to determine the longitudinal associations of aerobic physical activity, muscle-strengthening activity (MSA), and adiposity with CRF. Study participants were enrolled in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study and had ≥3 preventive medical examinations at the Cooper Clinic (Dallas, Texas) during 1987-2019. Aerobic activity and MSA were self-reported, and three measures of adiposity were clinically assessed: body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and waist circumference. CRF, expressed as metabolic equivalents (METs), was estimated by a maximal treadmill test. The longitudinal associations of aerobic activity, MSA, and adiposity with CRF were estimated using multivariable mixed linear regression models. The study included 6,105 participants who were followed for a median of 7.1 years. Most participants were men (83.6%), and their average age at baseline was 47.0 (SD: 8.7) years. Mean CRF at baseline was 12.2 (SD: 2.3) METs. Increasing aerobic activity (per 500 MET-minutes/week, β: 0.069, 95% CI: 0.064, 0.074 METs) or MSA (per days/week, β: 0.066, 95% CI: 0.058, 0.073 METs) was associated with increased CRF over time. Increasing BMI, body fat percentage, or waist circumference were each associated with decreased CRF over time. These data offer longitudinal evidence on how changes in aerobic activity, MSA, and various measures of adiposity (beyond BMI) independently correlate with CRF over time. Healthy lifestyle behaviors that include increasing aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity and limiting adiposity may positively influence the retention of fitness with age and improve downstream health outcomes.","Clare Meernik, Mickey Scheinowitz, David Leonard, Carolyn E Barlow, Tammy Leonard, Kelley Pettee Gabriel, Andjelka Pavlovic, Jarett D Berry, Laura F DeFina, Kerem Shuval","Medicine and science in sports and exercise","2024Oct01",NA
"39350348","Consumption responses to sweetened beverage taxes by household income in four U.S. cities.","Taxes on sweetened beverages have become an important policy response to growing obesity rates and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and other nations. Since 2015, eight U.S. cities have implemented these taxes, but so far direct evidence of their impacts on household purchasing behavior is scarce. Of particular interest to many researchers and policy makers is the response of lower-income consumers to these taxes, both because they have higher sweetened beverage consumption on average and because of concerns that sweetened beverage taxes are regressive. This project investigates the income-stratified household response to SSB taxes using a data set containing the purchasing behavior of approximately 400 households in the cities of Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland, and Philadelphia, all of which have recently introduced beverage taxes. Using doubly-robust estimation of dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects relative to a propensity-matched set of households in three comparison cities, we find that households in taxed cities experience increased prices and reduce their purchases of those beverages, with no evidence of cross-border shopping. We further find differential tax impacts by income level, with lower-income households (households with income <200% of the federal poverty line for their size) reducing their purchases of taxed beverages by nearly 50% - more than double the 18% reduction found in higher-income households (households with income >400% of the federal poverty line for their size). Our finding that lower-income households decrease their consumption more than twice as much as higher-income households suggests that these taxes may reduce health disparities and promote population health.","Melissa A Knox, Jessica C Jones-Smith","Health economics","2024Sep30",NA

Using the previously proposed 'cyclic obesity/weight-based stigma' (COBWEBS) model, the present study extended the framework to investigate the mediating effects of IWS and psychological distress in the association between PWS and FA among young adults. Given that individuals who are overweight/have obesity have different vulnerabilities, this population was separately analyzed alongside the total study population. An online survey comprising the Perceived Weight Stigma Scale, Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and modified Yale Food Addiction Scale Version 2 was completed by 601 participants (59.6% females; mean age 29.3 years [SD = 6.07]). A total of 219 participants were categorized as being overweight/having obesity. A direct correlation was found between PWS and FA (standardized coefficient [β] = 0.28, p < 0.001) among both populations, and was mediated by IWS and psychological distress (β [95% CI] = 0.03 [0.01, 0.05] for WBIS score and 0.10 [0.06, 0.14] for DASS-21 score) among the total participants, but only mediated by psychological distress among participants who were overweight/had obesity (β [95% CI] = 0.14 [0.06, 0.24]). The results demonstrated novel perspectives by showing the direct association between PWS and FA and the mediating roles of IWS and psychological distress. Treatment strategies such as psychological acceptance and psychoeducation could be used to reduce weight stigma, which could have positive downstream benefits of ameliorating FA. Future research may seek to study strategies for reducing weight stigma and psychological distress, to investigate their efficacy in improving disordered eating.","Po-Ching Huang, Janet D Latner, Nadia Bevan, Mark D Griffiths, Jung-Sheng Chen, Chi Hsien Huang, Kerry S O'Brien, Chung-Ying Lin","Journal of eating disorders","2024Sep30",NA

The relationship of parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding with MD is less clear. We examined the associations of these factors with MD within the International Consortium of Mammographic Density (ICMD). ICMD is a consortium of 27 studies with pooled individual-level epidemiological and MD data from 11,755 women without breast cancer aged 35-85 years from 22 countries, capturing 40 country-& ethnicity-specific population groups. MD was measured using the area-based tool Cumulus. Meta-analyses across population groups and pooled analyses were used to examine linear regression associations of square-root (√) transformed MD measures (percent MD (PMD), dense area (DA), and non-dense area (NDA)) with parity, age at first birth, ever/never breastfed and lifetime breastfeeding duration. Models were adjusted for age at mammogram, age at menarche, BMI, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy, calibration method, mammogram view and reader, and parity and age at first birth when not the association of interest. Among 10,988 women included in these analyses, 90.1% (n = 9,895) were parous, of whom 13% (n = 1,286) had ≥ five births. The mean age at first birth was 24.3 years (Standard deviation = 5.1). Increasing parity (per birth) was inversely associated with √PMD (β: - 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.07, - 0.03) and √DA (β: - 0.08, 95% CI: - 0.12, - 0.05) with this trend evident until at least nine births.

In stratified analyses, this association was only evident in women who were post-menopausal at MD assessment. Among parous women, no associations were found between ever/never breastfed or lifetime breastfeeding duration (per six-month increase) and √MD. Associations with higher parity and older age at first birth with √MD were consistent with the direction of their respective associations with breast cancer risk.

"39350201","Role of ultra-processed foods in modulating the effect of Mediterranean diet on human and planet health-study protocol of the PROMENADE randomized controlled trial.","The Mediterranean diet (MD), globally recognized for its sustainability and health benefits, traditionally emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods in raw or minimally processed forms. However, shifting lifestyles, even in Mediterranean regions, have led to an increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF). Epidemiological evidence suggests that UPF consumption may be detrimental to human health, but there is only one clinical trial on this topic which is largely debated in the scientific community. This study aims to investigate the impact of the inclusion of UPF within a Mediterranean-based dietary pattern on cardiometabolic markers, gut microbiota, and other markers of human and planet health. Fifty clinically healthy individuals showing overweight and presenting a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile will be recruited for a 7-month randomized, open, cross-over dietary trial. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a 3-month high-UPF MD (intervention group) or a low-UPF MD (control group), with a 1-month wash-out period. Both intervention diets will have identical food group compositions, with the intervention group consuming 5 servings/day of selected UPF items, and the control group consuming raw/minimally processed items from the same food group. Blood, urine, and fecal samples, alongside food/lifestyle diaries, will be collected from each participant before and after the dietary interventions. The primary endpoint will be the change in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels from baseline. Additional markers include blood pressure, anthropometric parameters, chemical parameters, glucose and lipid-related metabolic markers, incretins, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, fecal microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acids. Finally, food waste production will be evaluated through specific validated food diaries. The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Milan and the Tuscany Regional Ethics Committee of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria (AOU) - Careggi, Florence. Results from the PROMENADE study will improve knowledge about the impact of UPF consumption on human and planet health and will contribute to the scientific debate on this topic.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the odds of sarcopenia and its associated risk factors among Qatari adults (> 18 years), while exploring the modulating effects of health and lifestyle factors. Using a case-control design, data from 767 participants (481 cases with diabetes and 286 controls without diabetes) was collected from Qatar Biobank (QBB). Sociodemographic, lifestyle factors including dietary intake, anthropometric and biochemical measures were analyzed. Handgrip strength, Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and Bio-impedance were used to assess muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle quality, respectively. The risk of sarcopenia was estimated using the European consensus on definition and diagnosis of sarcopenia. Cases with diabetes were older (55 vs. 36 years; P < 0.001), had higher BMI (31.6 vs. 28.3 kg/m2; P < 0.001), lower cardiorespiratory fitness (50.0% ""Moderate"" fitness for cases, 62.9% ""High"" fitness for controls), and consumed less total (59.0 vs. 64.0; P = 0.004) and animal protein (39.0 vs. 42.0; P = 0.001), compared to controls based on a computed score. Participants with diabetes also had lower appendicular lean mass/BMI, handgrip strength, and higher probability of sarcopenia/probable sarcopenia (P < 0.005). Adjusted multiple logistic regression revealed that elevated cardiorespiratory fitness (β = 0.299, 95%CI:0.12-0.74) and blood triglycerides (β = 1.475, 95% CI: 1.024-2.124), as well as being a female (β = 0.086, 95%CI: 0.026-0.288) and having higher BMI (β = 0.908, 95%CI: 0.852-0.967) and ALM/BMI (β = 0.000, 95% CI: 0.000-0.007) are independent predictors (p < 0.05) of sarcopenia risk. This study highlights the intricate relationship between diabetes and sarcopenia, revealing modifiable risk factors. Individuals with diabetes were found to have a higher likelihood of sarcopenia, which was associated with lower fitness levels and higher blood triglycerides. Protective factors against sarcopenia included being female and having higher BMI and ALM/BMI ratios.","Hibeh Shatila, Nour Ghazal, Ghalya Bukshaisha, Shaikha Al-Zeyara, Cosette Fakih El Khoury, Maya Bassil","BMC endocrine disorders","2024Sep30","Humans; Sarcopenia; Case-Control Studies; Male; Female; Qatar; Middle Aged; Adult; Risk Factors; Biological Specimen Banks; Diabetes Mellitus; Hand Strength; Aged; Cohort Studies; Prognosis; Follow-Up Studies"

In the first South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1), traditional [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)] and novel [a-body shape index (ABSI), abdominal volume index (AVI), body adiposity index (BAI), body roundness index (BRI), conicity index (CI), and Clínica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator (CUN-BAE)] anthropometric indices were assessed. T2D was diagnosed using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% among participants without known T2D. Basic statistics and multiple regression analyses were explored the association between anthropometric indices and newly diagnosed T2D. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to measure the predictive ability of both traditional and novel indices. Among 2 623 participants, 384 (14.6%) had newly diagnosed T2D. All anthropometric indices mean values were significantly higher among participants with T2D (most p < 0.001). Higher mean values increased T2D odds e.g., in the model adjusted for age, employment, residence, and population group, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for T2D with some of anthropometric indices were: 1.86 (1.60-2.15) for WC, 1.84 (1.59-2.13) for WHtR, 1.73 (1.51-1.99) for AVI, 1.71 (1.49-1.96) for BRI and 1.86 (1.57-2.20) for CUN-BAE. The top quartile for all indices had the highest T2D odds (p < 0.05). These outcomes were the highest for WC, AVI, and CUN-BAE and remained so even after removing the confounding effects of age, employment, population group, and residence. Based on the ROC analysis, none of the anthropometrical indices performed excellently (i.e., had an area under the curve [AUC] > 0.80). The WC, WHtR, AVI, BRI, and CUN-BAE, however, performed acceptably (AUCs 0.70-0.79), while also exhibiting corresponding cutoff values of 86.65 cm, 0.57, 15.52, 3.83, and 38.35, respectively.

"39350138","Recreational screen time and obesity risk in Korean children: a 3-year prospective cohort study.","Studies have shown that prolonged television watching increases obesity risk among children. However, few studies examined the associations with other types of screen time, such as computer and smartphone use, using a prospective cohort study design. Further, little is known about the specific non-screen time activity that may yield the most benefits when reallocating screen time to other activities. We conducted a prospective cohort analysis using 3-year follow-up data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018 (n = 2,023; 4th grade elementary students who were not obese at baseline). Average time spent watching television, using computer and smartphone, and other after-school activities were self-reported at baseline. Weight and height were also self-reported at baseline and follow-up surveys through 2021. We performed multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between screen time and obesity incidence, adjusting for potential confounders. We also performed isotemporal substitution models to examine the associations of reallocating screen time to other non-screen time activities (physical activity, sleeping, hanging out with friends, reading, studying, and chatting with parents) in an equal time-exchange manner. Longer combined screen time (≥ 240 vs. <120 m/d) was statistically significantly associated with an increased obesity risk (OR [95% CI] = 1.68 [1.03, 2.73]). The direction of associations with television watching (≥ 180 vs. <60 m/d: OR [95% CI] = 2.86 [1.58, 5.20]), computer use (≥ 120 vs. <60 m/d: 1.38 [0.52, 3.64]), and smartphone use (≥ 180 vs. <60 m/d: 1.42 [0.76, 2.65]) were all positive, although the association was most apparent and statistically significant for television watching only. The associations did not change after additional adjustment for other lifestyle factors, including physical activity, sleep, and breakfast skipping. In the isotemporal substitution models, reallocating 1-hour of screen time to reading (OR [95% CI] = 0.67 [0.48, 0.93]) was associated with a decreased obesity risk. Reallocating 1-hour of screen time to physical activity was only marginally significantly associated with obesity risk (0.79 [0.62, 1.01]). Our data suggest that more efforts should focus on reducing screen time and increasing time for other non-screen time activities, particularly reading, for obesity prevention in children.","Hajin Jang, Yoonkyoung Cho, Hannah Oh","The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity","2024Sep30","Humans; Screen Time; Prospective Studies; Female; Male; Republic of Korea; Child; Pediatric Obesity; Television; Exercise; Sedentary Behavior; Risk Factors; Smartphone; Recreation; Follow-Up Studies; Computers"
"39350110","Prevalence of bronchiectasis in adults: a meta-analysis.","Bronchiectasis, once considered an orphan disease, is receiving attention globally owing to its increasing prevalence, healthcare burden, and associated morbidity. However, the prevalence of bronchiectasis is unclear. This meta-analysis estimates the prevalence of bronchiectasis in adults, providing a valuable reference for future research. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 31, 2024 for studies reporting the prevalence of bronchiectasis. Study selection, data extraction, and overall analysis of risk of the retrieved studies were conducted independently by two authors. The tool for assessing the risk of bias in prevalence studies was used to evaluate overall risk. Stata software (version 15.1) was used to performed the meta-analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plots combined with Egger's test were used to detect publication bias. The pooled prevalence of bronchiectasis in adults from 15 studies covering 437,851,478 individuals was 680 per 100,000 (95% CI: 634-727 per 100,000). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of bronchiectasis in the United States, Korea, and China was 478 per 100,000 (95% CI: 367-588 per 100,000), 886 per 100,000 (95% CI: 778-993 per 100,000), and 759 per 100,000 (95% CI: 35-2399 per 100,000), respectively; 467 per 100,000 (95% CI: 416-518 per 100,000) in males and 535 per 100,000 (95% CI: 477-592 per 100,000) in females; 3958 per 100,000 (95% CI: 117-12637 per 100,000), 4677 per 100,000 (95% CI: 427-8928 per 100,000), and 3630 per 100,000 (95% CI: 158-7103 per 100,000) among never-smokers, ever-smokers, and current smokers, respectively; 430 per 100,000 (95% CI: 411-450 per 100,000), 380 per 100,000 (95% CI: 374-386 per 100,000), and 351 per 100,000 (95% CI: 342-360 per 100,000) among individuals with body mass index<18.5, 18.5-24.9, and ≥ 25, respectively.

"39350099","Associations of metabolic syndrome and its components with sarcopenia, and the mediating role of insulin resistance: Findings from NHANES database.","To investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components with sarcopenia, and to explore the extent to which insulin resistance (IR) mediates this association, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We analyzed cross-sectional data from 15,779 adults in the NHANES from 1999 to 2006 and 2011-2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) between MetS, its components, the number of MetS components, and sarcopenia. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in MetS and its components-induced sarcopenia. In the fully adjusted model, MetS increased the prevalence of sarcopenia by 1.96-fold (95% CI: 1.73-2.22). Among the individual components, central obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia were associated with an increased prevalence of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia prevalence also increased linearly with the number of MetS components, with the highest prevalence observed in the presence of all five components (OR: 3.80, 95% CI: 2.79-5.16). Sex-stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of MetS for sarcopenia was higher in males than females. The mediating effects of HOMA-IR on the association between MetS and its components (central obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia) with sarcopenia were significant, with mediation effects of 51.7%, 30.7%, 33.2%, and 79.1%, respectively. There was no significant direct association between hyperglycemia and sarcopenia beyond the HOMA-IR pathway. MetS and its individual components, excluding hypertriglyceridemia and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol, were associated with a higher prevalence of sarcopenia, especially in males. This association was partially or fully mediated by IR.","Minghui Li, Rong Ji, Xi Liu, Yongjian Wu","BMC endocrine disorders","2024Sep30","Humans; Sarcopenia; Metabolic Syndrome; Male; Female; Insulin Resistance; Nutrition Surveys; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Adult; Prevalence; Aged; United States; Databases, Factual"
"39350083","Insulin resistance and insulin secretory defect among Bangalee PCOS women: a case-control study.","Insulin resistance (IR) is a well-recognized covariate of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) with varying burden and risk factors among populations. The relationship of insulin secretory defect or ISD with PCOS is less understood. The presence of IR and ISD as well as their covariates have been explored in the present case-control study among young adult to early middle-aged, normal weight to obese, Bangalee women with PCOS. A number of 158 PCOS [age 23 (15-34) years, Median (Range)] and 126 Non-PCOS [24 (19-34) years] females were recruited purposively with PCOS diagnosed following Modified Rotterdam Criteria 2003. Hormones were measured by CLIA method and lower abdominal ultrasonography was done by trained personnel. IR and ISD were assessed by homeostasis model assessment with 75th percentile values of HOMA-IR (2.4) and HOMA%B (143) in Non-PCOS group considered as the cut-off values. Hyperandrogenism (HA) was measured by calculating Fasting Androgen Index (FAI). HOMA-IR was high among 52% of PCOS and 28% of Non-PCOS women. Body Mass Index (BMI) and HA were independently associated covariates of IR (p < 0.001). HOMA%B was compromised among 48% of PCOS subjects and the deficiency showed independent association (p < 0.001) with 2 h glycemia on OGTT in Non-PCOS and HA in PCOS groups. The data suggest insulin resistance as a major risk factor for PCOS among Bangalee women with obesity and hyperandrogenemia as its major covariates. The findings also indicate that presence of impaired insulin secretion is a major determinant of hyperglycemia and, consequently, of higher T2DM risk among young women in this population.","Jannatul Nayeem, M M Towhidul Islam, Farzana Deeba, Shahjada Selim, Liaquat Ali, Yearul Kabir","BMC endocrine disorders","2024Sep30","Humans; Female; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Insulin Resistance; Case-Control Studies; Adult; Young Adult; Adolescent; Insulin; Body Mass Index; Hyperandrogenism; India; Insulin Secretion; Risk Factors; Blood Glucose"
"39350053","Prevalence of sarcopenic obesity: comparison of different diagnostic criteria and exploration of optimal screening methods.","Despite concerns on the adverse health outcomes of sarcopenic obesity (SO), exploration regarding the applicability of different diagnostic criteria and the optimal screening methods is still lacking. This study aims to compare the prevalence and diagnostic agreement of SO under four diagnostic criteria in Chongming, Shanghai, China and assess the diagnostic value of nine screening methods for SO. The study population included older people aged ≥ 65 years. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia-2019 (AWGS-2019) was used to diagnose sarcopenia. Obesity was defined using percentage of body fat (PBF), percent of body fat exceeding the 60th percentile (60% PBF), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). The four diagnostic criteria for SO were AWGS + PBF, AWGS + 60% PBF, AWGS + BMI and AWGS + WC. Nine screening methods were the sarcopenia questionnaire [the questionnaire with five items to screen for sarcopenia (SARC-F), the addition of calf circumference to the SARC-F (SARC-CalF), and the addition of elderly age and BMI to the SARC-F (SARC-F + EBM)] combined with commonly used obesity indicators. Cohen's kappa compared agreement between diagnostic criteria, whilst sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) compared the diagnostic value of nine screening methods. A total of 1407 older people were enrolled. The prevalence of SO ranged from 0.3 to 9.9%. The highest agreement between AWGS + 60% PBF and AWGS + PBF. When the AWGS + PBF was used as the 'gold standard' (due to its high agreement and high prevalence), SARC-CalF + PBF had the highest AUC value, and SARC-F + BMI had the highest sensitivity. The recommended cut-off values for SARC-F + BMI are SARC-F ≥ 1 score and BMI ≥ 19.845 kg/m², and the recommended cut-off values for SARC-CalF + PBF are SARC-CalF ≥ 5 score and PBF ≥ 34.55%. The prevalence of SO varied greatly amongst the four diagnostic criteria. AWGS + PBF is recommended for diagnosing SO in older people.

"39349881","Accuracy of self-perceived cardiovascular disease risk and factors predicting risk underestimation in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in Ismailia, Egypt.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, with women at higher risk after menopause. This increased risk is attributed to both aging and hormonal changes. Prior research has established a link between CVD risk perception and adopting healthy behaviors to prevent CVD. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of self-perceived CVD risk in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to identify factors that predict CVD risk underestimation among them. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the administrative sectors of Suez Canal University campus in Ismailia, Egypt, over a period of eight months starting in July 2022. A total of 390 eligible women (employees and workers) were randomly selected. Participants were interviewed to obtain data on demographics, medical history, self-perceived risk of CVD, self-perceived general health, awareness of factors that increase the risk of developing CVD, perceived stress, health literacy, numeracy, and self-perceived 10-year risk of developing major cardiovascular events. They also underwent measurements of blood pressure, weight, and height. The updated 2019 WHO/CVD risk non-laboratory-based prediction chart for the North Africa and Middle East Region was used to predict the 10-year risk of major cardiovascular events for the study participants. Risk accuracy was measured by comparing self-perceived CVD risk with predicted CVD risk. The ratio of self-perceived to predicted moderate/high CVD risk was 27.7% to 44.3%, respectively. The accuracy of CVD risk perception was 68.2%. Kappa analysis results showed fair and significant agreement between self-perceived and predicted CVD risk (kappa ± SE = 35.9 ± 4.1%, p < 0 .001). The proportion of women who underestimated their risks was 24.1%. Of those in the high-risk group, 93.3% underestimated their CVD risk, compared to 50.6% in the moderate-risk group. Factors that significantly predicted CVD risk underestimation included being married (aOR 14.5; 95% CI 1.4-149.9), low income (aOR 2.321; 95% CI 1.09-4.909), high BMI (aOR 4.78; 95% CI 1.9-11.9), hypertension (aOR 3.5; 95% CI 2-6.2), and old age (aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Approximately one-third of our study participants misperceived their CVD risk; of those who did, 75.8% underestimated it. Marital status, old age, low income, high BMI, and hypertension strongly predicted CVD risk underestimation. These findings identified the menopausal women subgroups that could benefit from targeted health interventions designed to reduce CVD risk underestimation and improve risk accuracy.","Mirella Youssef Tawfik, Hanan H Soliman, Zeinab F Abdel-Fatah","The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association","2024Oct01",NA
"39349772","Role of human plasma metabolites in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes from the IMI-DIRECT study.","Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that is caused by hyperglycaemia. Our aim was to characterise the metabolomics to find their association with the glycaemic spectrum and find a causal relationship between metabolites and type 2 diabetes. As part of the Innovative Medicines Initiative - Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification (IMI-DIRECT) consortium, 3000 plasma samples were measured with the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p150 Kit and Metabolon analytics. A total of 911 metabolites (132 targeted metabolomics, 779 untargeted metabolomics) passed the quality control. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analysis estimates were calculated from the concentration/peak areas of each metabolite as an explanatory variable and the glycaemic status as a dependent variable. This analysis was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, study centre in the basic model, and additionally for alcohol, smoking, BP, fasting HDL-cholesterol and fasting triacylglycerol in the full model. Statistical significance was Bonferroni corrected throughout. Beyond associations, we investigated the mediation effect and causal effects for which causal mediation test and two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2SMR) methods were used, respectively. In the targeted metabolomics, we observed four (15), 34 (99) and 50 (108) metabolites (number of metabolites observed in untargeted metabolomics appear in parentheses) that were significantly different when comparing normal glucose regulation vs impaired glucose regulation/prediabetes, normal glucose regulation vs type 2 diabetes, and impaired glucose regulation vs type 2 diabetes, respectively. Significant metabolites were mainly branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), with some derivatised BCAAs, lipids, xenobiotics and a few unknowns. Metabolites such as lysophosphatidylcholine a C17:0, sum of hexoses, amino acids from BCAA metabolism (including leucine, isoleucine, valine, N-lactoylvaline, N-lactoylleucine and formiminoglutamate) and lactate, as well as an unknown metabolite (X-24295), were associated with HbA1c progression rate and were significant mediators of type 2 diabetes from baseline to 18 and 48 months of follow-up. 2SMR was used to estimate the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome using summary statistics from UK Biobank genome-wide association studies. We found that type 2 diabetes had a causal effect on the levels of three metabolites (hexose, glutamate and caproate [fatty acid (FA) 6:0]), whereas lipids such as specific phosphatidylcholines (PCs) (namely PC aa C36:2, PC aa C36:5, PC ae C36:3 and PC ae C34:3) as well as the two n-3 fatty acids stearidonate (18:4n3) and docosapentaenoate (22:5n3) potentially had a causal role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Our findings identify known BCAAs and lipids, along with novel N-lactoyl-amino acid metabolites, significantly associated with prediabetes and diabetes, that mediate the effect of diabetes from baseline to follow-up (18 and 48 months). Causal inference using genetic variants shows the role of lipid metabolism and n-3 fatty acids as being causal for metabolite-to-type 2 diabetes whereas the sum of hexoses is causal for type 2 diabetes-to-metabolite. Identified metabolite markers are useful for stratifying individuals based on their risk progression and should enable targeted interventions.","Sapna Sharma, Qiuling Dong, Mark Haid, Jonathan Adam, Roberto Bizzotto, Juan J Fernandez-Tajes, Angus G Jones, Andrea Tura, Anna Artati, Cornelia Prehn, Gabi Kastenmüller, Robert W Koivula, Paul W Franks, Mark Walker, Ian M Forgie, Giuseppe Giordano, Imre Pavo, Hartmut Ruetten, Manolis Dermitzakis, Mark I McCarthy, Oluf Pedersen, Jochen M Schwenk, Konstantinos D Tsirigos, Federico De Masi, Soren Brunak, Ana Viñuela, Andrea Mari, Timothy J McDonald, Tarja Kokkola, Jerzy Adamski, Ewan R Pearson, Harald Grallert","Diabetologia","2024Sep30",NA
"39349598","Bariatric surgery decreases prescription drug costs for metabolic syndrome: a Canadian population-based cohort study.","Obesity is a chronic disease that is significantly linked to metabolic syndrome. Bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment for obesity resulting in long-term weight loss and comorbidity resolution. Prior studies have demonstrated the overall cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery; however, there is little data regarding direct pharmaceutical costs. The objective of this population-based study is to compare the cost of dispensed common prescription medications for metabolic syndrome before and after bariatric surgery. All patients that were enrolled in the Center for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery who underwent gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy between 2013 and 2019 in Manitoba were included. Basic demographic information and outpatient prescription dispensation data were obtained from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository, which is housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Specific drug categories that were reviewed for costs 5 years before and after surgery included Antihypertensives, Lipid Lowering Agents, Insulin and Non-insulin Diabetic Drugs. One thousand one hundred and eighty four patients were included in this review. Comparing the 5-year pre- and post-surgery, there was a decrease in the overall amount of drug dispensed and the overall cost for all drug categories in the 5 years following surgery. These categories included Antihypertensives ($506,268.8), Lipid Lowering Agents ($173,866.48), Insulin ($549,305.92), and Other Diabetes Drugs ($513,371.1). Additionally, older patients experienced a larger proportion of cost savings compared to younger patients, with the exception of non-insulin diabetic medications which trended to have more cost savings in the 30-49 year old grouping. This is the first Canadian study to use accurate dispensing data from a provincial administrative prescription database to capture long-term cost savings for metabolic prescriptions after bariatric surgery. The results are consistent with the existing literature for prescriptions post-bariatric surgery. Future study will include subgroup analysis by patient age, gender, income quintile, and geography.","Hayley Forbes, Wenjing He, Isuru Dharmasena, Heather J Prior, Ashley Vergis, Krista Hardy","Surgical endoscopy","2024Sep30",NA

"39349398","Respiratory dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors: A single institution study.","Recently, while the overall survival rate of childhood cancer has improved, research has highlighted a high incidence of comorbidities in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs). However, it is likely that many asymptomatic comorbidities go unnoticed. The purpose of the current study was to identify comorbidities unique to Japanese CCSs through comparisons with a general population that underwent comparable comprehensive medical checkups. The patient group included CCSs who had completed their cancer treatment, were aged 16 years or older, and underwent the comprehensive medical checkups at the University of Tsukuba Hospital between 2018 and 2020. The control group included members of the general population who underwent comprehensive medical checkups at the same hospital in 2018. Seventeen CCSs and 59 controls were included. Among the CCSs, the median ages at medical checkup and diagnosis were 22.1 years (range, 16-39) and 8.7 years (range, 1.3-14.8), respectively. Incidence of abnormalities in respiratory function, hearing function, and body mass index was higher in CCSs (52.9%, p = 0.013; 17.6%, p < 0.001; and 41.2%, p = 0.080, respectively) compared with controls. Asymptomatic pulmonary dysfunction was detected in the comprehensive medical checkup as a unique comorbidity in CCSs. Because the odds ratio of mortality due to respiratory failure is high in CCSs, as previously reported, we believe that detection of pulmonary dysfunction and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle are important. The evaluation of the pulmonary function may not typically be included in routine clinical visits, but it could be necessary for comprehensive medical evaluation in CCSs.","Hiroko Fukushima, Ryoko Suzuki, Yuni Yamaki, Sho Hosaka, Masako Inaba, Takahiro Kido, Kouji Masumoto, Ai Muroi, Hideo Suzuki, Hidetoshi Takada","Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society","2024Jan-Dec","Humans; Male; Female; Adolescent; Cancer Survivors; Child; Young Adult; Adult; Comorbidity; Japan; Neoplasms; Child, Preschool; Incidence; Case-Control Studies; Infant; Retrospective Studies; Respiration Disorders"

"39349264","Preventability of ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack in a tertiary care center in Argentina.","Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with many individuals presenting with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (AIS/TIA) due to underlying vascular risk factors (VRF). While these patients typically undergo routine evaluations for acute treatment, the prevention of these conditions is often underestimated. This study reports the prevalence of non-optimized VRF and estimates their degree of avoidability in a cohort of patients treated in a tertiary care center following AIS/TIA. This retrospective study enrolled patients older than 18 years who experienced AIS/TIA over a two-year period. Preventability was defined as the degree to which an acute cerebrovascular event could have been prevented if the VRF had been appropriately treated. Using the variables determined at the onset of AIS or TIA, we developed a 10-point scale to classify the degree of preventability (not preventable [score of 0], low preventability [score of 1-3], and high preventability [score of 4 or higher]). We further defined sub-scores based on the effectiveness of treatment of high blood pressure [HBP] (0-2 points), dyslipidemia [DLP] (0-2 points), atrial fibrillation [AF] (1 point), active smoking [AS] (1 point), obesity (1 point), previous coronary heart disease [CHD] (1 point), and previous AIS/TIA (2 points). Demographic factors, etiologies, and imaging findings were evaluated, tabulated independently, and subsequently correlated with clinical findings extracted from the available patient records. Of the 395 patients (334 with AIS and 61 with TIA), 376 (95.19%) exhibited some degree of preventability, whereas 19 (4.81%) presented with a nonpreventable event. In total, 296 (74.94%) presented a low preventable event, and 80 (20.25%) presented a high preventable event. Applying the Chi-square test of independence to stroke etiology highlighted cardio-aortic embolism and large artery atherosclerosis as groups with a significantly higher burden of risk factors necessitating intervention, while patients with stroke of other etiologies had more adequate control of VRF. In terms of stroke severity, as determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), patients with NIHSS scores >5 were more likely to experience preventable events. According to the ABCD2 score, higher risk scores were significantly associated with a higher preventive factor burden; however, age, sex, vascular territory, and Canadian TIA scores were not related to the prevention of AIS/TIA. The high percentage of preventable events reflects the need to study other factors that may contribute to unhealthy lifestyles in this population. Potential reasons for poor health include high levels of stress, sleep deprivation, working conditions and an unhealthy diet. Further studies are required to better understand these phenomena.","Juan Antonio Pozo Putalivo, Martin Grecco, Guillermo Pablo Povedano, Mauricio De Sampaio, Sofia Caporale, Santajuliana Franco","Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association","2024Sep28",NA
"39349122","Clinical impact of visceral adiposity on long-term mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.","Although visceral adiposity increases cardiovascular risk in the general population, the obesity paradox has been reported in critically ill patients. However, evidence for its prognostic role in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is limited. This study evaluated the prognostic implications of visceral adiposity in patients who underwent CABG using computed tomography-based measurement of visceral fat. A total of 2810 patients who underwent CABG from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed. The study population was classified into 3 groups according to visceral fat area index (VFAI) tertiles. VFAI was calculated as visceral fat area (cm2)/height2 (m2) at the L3 level. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Patients in the low VFAI group (lowest tertile) were younger and had a lower body mass index and less subcutaneous fat than those in the high VFAI group (highest tertile). During a median 8.7-year follow-up, VFAI was significantly associated with the risk of mortality in restricted cubic spline curve analysis (HR, 0.94 per 10 increases; 95%CI, 0.91-0.97; P  <  .001). Patients in the low VFAI group had a higher incidence of long-term mortality than those in the intermediate and high VFAI groups (T1 36.1%, T2 27.2%, and T3 29.1%; T1 vs T2; adjusted HR, 1.36; 95%CI, 1.15-1.61; P  <  .001; T1 vs T; adjusted HR, 1.37; 95%CI, 1.16-1.62; P  <  .001).

Emotional and uncontrolled eating scores were higher in the A+B-phenotype compared to women without PCOS, while uncontrolled eating scores in the C-phenotype were higher than in women without PCOS and the D-phenotype. At age 46, the perception of overweight was an independent predictor of emotional eating among women with PCOS (B=11.96 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.81-20.29], p=0.008), while a history of weight loss attempts was a predictor of uncontrolled eating (B=6.06 [95% CI: 1.05-10.83], p=0.015). Among women with PCOS, higher psychological distress at age 31 was a significant risk factor for scoring in the highest quartile of emotional (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.85 [95% CI: 1.19-6.85], p=0.019) and uncontrolled eating (aOR: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.77-10.80], p=0.001) at age 46. Women with PCOS at midlife showed a high tendency for unfavorable eating behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for sensitivity in weight management counseling and addressing psychological distress to prevent unfavorable eating in this population.","Emilia Pesonen, Marjukka Nurkkala, Meri-Maija Ollila, Elisa Hurskainen, Laure C Morin-Papunen, Timo Jämsä, Raija Korpelainen, Maisa Niemelä, Terhi T Piltonen","Fertility and sterility","2024Sep28",NA
"39349105","Lifestyle aspects are associated with common mental disorders in women over 40 years older in a population-based study.","Common mental disorders (CMD) are more prevalent in women, as well as noncommunicable diseases. Diet and physical activity are lifestyle modifiable factors that might help on managing these conditions. This study aimed to investigate the association between lifestyle aspects (diet and physical activity) and common mental disorders in women aged 40+ years. This is a cross-sectional, population-based study (2015 ISA-Nutrition) with a representative sample of São Paulo-SP-Brazil urban residents. The present study was conducted with data from 467 women aged 40+ years old. Common Mental Disorders (dependent variable) were investigated by the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20); the independent variables of interest were: the inflammatory potential of the diet was evaluated by dietary inflammatory index (DII), and physical activity level (evaluated by IPAQ) adopting the leisure dimension of physical activity. We considered as adjusting variables the presence of self-reported Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD), the age intervals (defined as 40-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, 61+ years old), schooling, (according to years of formal education), Body Mass Index (BMI); and ethnicity (self-declared skin color). Simple and multi-adjusted logistic regression models were performed to investigate the associations. The main findings indicate that the prevalence of CMD was 32.2%, and the frequency of having one or more NCD was 67.2%. In the final regression model, CMD was associated with the highest tertile of the DII (OR=2.215; p=0.003) and having three, and four or more NCD (OR= 6. 735; p<0.001, and OR= 3.874; p=0.033, respectively). Altogether, our results indicate that dietary inflammatory characteristics, and physical activity, along with NCD, are associated with CMD, in women aged 40+ years old, in different dimensions.","João Valentini Neto, Amália Almeida Bastos, Marcelo Macedo Rogero, Regina Mara Fisberg, Sandra Maria Lima Ribeiro","Clinical nutrition ESPEN","2024Sep28",NA
"39348955","Hotspots of Anal Cancer Screening in a High-risk Population: A Clinical Study on Free Provision, Best Method, Self-sampling, and Independent Risk Factors.","As of 2024, anal cancer (AC) has been steadily increasing worldwide but, due to insufficient evidence, anal cancer screening (ACS) has yet to be standardized. Furthermore, most high-risk people in the world have no help paying for it. Therefore, our primary endpoint was to assess the best screening method for these subjects through a provision that was free of charge (all costs were covered by the Italian public health service). Awareness-raising campaign, determination of risk factors, education on anal self-examination, and sampling (ASS) were secondary objectives. Screening was on a voluntary basis. Engaging in receptive anal intercourse and having a history of cervical dysplasia were the main inclusion criteria. Level 1 ACS tools included digital ano-rectal examination, anoscopy, anal Pap, and anal human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test (both through self- and proctologist- sampling); high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with (HRAB) or without biopsy comprised level 2 screening. High-risk people were enrolled until the available funds were exhausted. Fifty high-risk people (40 men who had sex with men -MSM-, 9 women, and 1 heterosexual man) were enrolled. AC was found in one HIV-seropositive MSM, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in 10 (20%) MSM, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion LSIL in 13 cases (12 MSM and 1 woman). The combination of HRAB and Pap smear screening achieved the highest values for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. ASS HPV DNA test provided excellent results comparable to clinician retrieval. Overweight and college education were identified as independent factors for the risk of and prevention of AC, respectively. A free ACS not only appears justified but also recommended to people screened for AC. Excess weight represents a further risk for this population.","Edoardo Virgilio, Carlo Salvemini, Maria Grazia Treglia, Elena Thai, Eva Franchi, Sara Panico, Luigi Ippolito, Clara Pavlidis, Alfredo Annicchiarico, Enrico Maria Silini, Renato Costi","Anticancer research","2024Oct","Humans; Anus Neoplasms; Male; Female; Early Detection of Cancer; Risk Factors; Middle Aged; Adult; Papillomavirus Infections; Italy; Aged; Self-Examination"
"39348912","The effect of combined malnutrition and obesity on trauma and orthopaedic surgery outcomes.","To determine whether obesity and malnutrition have a synergistic effect on outcomes from skeletal trauma or elective orthopaedic surgery. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PEDRo were searched up to 14 April 2024, as well as conference proceedings and the reference lists of included studies. Studies were appraised using tools according to study design, including the Oxford Levels of Evidence, the Institute of Health Economics case series quality appraisal checklist, and the CLARITY checklist for cohort studies. Studies were eligible if they reported the effects of combined malnutrition and obesity on outcomes from skeletal trauma or elective orthopaedic surgery. A total of eight studies (106,319 patients) were included. These carried moderate to high risk of bias. Combined obesity and malnutrition did not lead to worse outcomes in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty or repair of proximal humeral fractures (two retrospective cohort studies). Three studies (two retrospective cohort studies, one case series) found that malnourishment and obesity had a synergistic effect and led to poor outcomes in total hip or knee arthroplasty, including longer length of stay and higher complication rates. One retrospective cohort study pertaining to posterior lumbar fusion found that malnourished obese patients had higher odds of developing surgical site infection and sepsis, as well as higher odds of requiring a revision procedure. Combined malnutrition and obesity have a synergistic effect and lead to poor outcomes in lower limb procedures. Appropriate preoperative optimization and postoperative care are required to improve outcomes in this group of patients.","Diego A Abelleyra Lastoria, Chigoziem Ogbolu, Olufemi Olatigbe, Rebecca Beni, Ahsan Iftikhar, Caroline B Hing","The bone & joint journal","2024Oct01","Humans; Malnutrition; Obesity; Orthopedic Procedures; Postoperative Complications; Elective Surgical Procedures"
"39348894","Pre- and postoperative Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee classification and its impact on clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty.","The Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) classification has been developed to predict individual variations in inherent knee alignment. The impact of preoperative and postoperative CPAK classification phenotype on the postoperative clinical outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains elusive. This study aimed to examine the effect of postoperative CPAK classification phenotypes (I to IX), and their pre- to postoperative changes on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). A questionnaire was administered to 340 patients (422 knees) who underwent primary TKA for osteoarthritis (OA) between September 2013 and June 2019. A total of 231 patients (284 knees) responded. The -Knee Society Score 2011 (KSS 2011), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-12 (KOOS-12), and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) were used to assess clinical outcomes. Using preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior full-leg radiographs, the arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA) and joint line obliquity (JLO) were calculated and classified based on the CPAK classification. To investigate the impact on PROMs, multivariable regression analyses using stepwise selection were conducted, considering factors such as age at surgery, time since surgery, BMI, sex, implant use, postoperative aHKA classification, JLO classification, and changes in aHKA and JLO classifications from preoperative to postoperative. The preoperative and postoperative CPAK classifications were predominantly phenotype I (155 knees; 55%) and phenotype V (73 knees; 26%), respectively. The change in the preoperative to postoperative aHKA classification was a significant negative predictive factor for KOOS-12 and FJS-12, while postoperative apex proximal JLO was a significant negative predictive factor for KSS 2011 and KOOS-12. In primary TKA for OA, preoperative and postoperative CPAK phenotypes were associated with PROMs. Alteration in varus/valgus alignment from preoperative to postoperative was recognized as a negative predictive factor for both KOOS-12 and FJS-12. Moreover, the postoperative apex proximal JLO was identified as a negative factor for KSS 2011 and KOOS-12. Determining the target alignment for each preoperative phenotype with reproducibility could improve PROMs.","Toshiki Konishi, Satoshi Hamai, Hidetoshi Tsushima, Shinya Kawahara, Yukio Akasaki, Satoshi Yamate, Shuhei Ayukawa, Yasuharu Nakashima","The bone & joint journal","2024Oct01","Humans; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Female; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Middle Aged; Knee Joint; Treatment Outcome; Postoperative Period; Surveys and Questionnaires; Preoperative Period; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies"
"39348833","Assessing the built environment through photographs and its association with obesity in 21 countries: the PURE Study.","The built environment can influence human health, but the available evidence is modest and almost entirely from urban communities in high-income countries. Here we aimed to analyse built environment characteristics and their associations with obesity in urban and rural communities in 21 countries at different development levels participating in the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) Study. Photographs were acquired with a standardised approach. We used the previously validated Environmental Profile of a Community's Health photo instrument to evaluate photos for safety, walkability, neighbourhood beautification, and community disorder. An integrated built environment score (ie, a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 20) was used to summarise this evaluation across built environment domains. Associations between built environment characteristics, separately and combined in the integrated built environment score, and obesity (ie, a BMI >30kg/m2) were assessed using multilevel regression models, adjusting for individual, household, and community confounding factors. Attenuation in the associations due to walking was examined. Analyses include 143 338 participants from 530 communities. The mean integrated built environment score was higher in high-income countries (13·3, SD 2·8) compared with other regions (10·1, 2·5) and urban communities (11·2, 3·0). More than 60% of high-income country communities had pedestrian safety features (eg, crosswalks, sidewalks, and traffic signals). Urban communities outside high-income countries had higher rates of sidewalks (176 [84%] of 209) than rural communities (59 [28%] of 209). 15 (5%) of 290 urban communities had bike lanes. Litter and graffiti were present in 372 (70%) of 530 communities, and poorly maintained buildings were present in 103 (19%) of 530. The integrated built environment score was significantly associated with reduced obesity overall (relative risk [RR] 0·58, 95% CI 0·35-0·93; p=0·025) for high compared with low scores and for increasing trend (0·85, 0·78-0·91; p<0·0001). The trends were statistically significant in urban (0·85, 0·77-0·93; p=0·0007) and rural (0·87, 0·78-0·97; p=0·015) communities. Some built environment features were associated with a lower prevalence of obesity: community beautification RR 0·75 (95% CI 0·61-0·92; p=0·0066); bike lanes RR 0·58 (0·45-0·73; p<0·0001); pedestrian safety RR 0·75 (0·62-0·90; p=0·0018); and traffic signals RR 0·68 (0·52-0·89; p=0·0055). Community disorder was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity (RR 1·48, 95% CI 1·17-1·86; p=0·0010). Community built environment features recorded in photographs, including bike lanes, pedestrian safety measures, beautification, traffic density, and disorder, were related to obesity after adjusting for confounders, and stronger associations were found in urban than rural communities.

"39348587","The Relationship Between Liver Fibrosis Scores and Ascending Aortic Dilatation.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is related to an increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. This study investigated a potential relationship between liver fibrosis scores (LFS) reflecting NAFLD and ascending aortic dilatation (AAD). This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Patients were consecutively enrolled from a cardiology clinic. The NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio (APRI), and BARD scores of each patient were calculated. The ascending aortic diameters were evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography according to current clinical guidelines. The patients were allocated into two groups with and without AAD. A total of 272 patients were included in the study. In AAD group, age, patients with hypertension (HT), coronary artery disease (CAD), FIB-4 index, BARD score and the NFS were significantly higher. As compared to the AAD group, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin, and diuretic use were significantly higher in patients without aortic dilatation. The NFS with AAD, and NFS and FIB-4 index with indexed aortic diameter (AI) showed significant positive correlation (R=0.546, R=0.332, R=0.314 with p<0.001, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis hemoglobin levels (OR=0.728, 95%CI: 0.553-0.958; p=0.023), BMI (OR=0.762, 95%CI: 0.668-0.869, p<0.001), HT (OR=3.269, 95%CI: 1.045-10.220; p=0.042), BARD score (OR=1.248, 95%CIL 0.815-1.955; p=0.044), and FIB-4 index (OR=2.432, 95%CI: 1.395-4.246; p=0.002) were found to be independently related to AAD. Our study demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between NFS, FIB-4 index, BARD score and AAD. The presence of positive correlation among LFS and AAD in our study is remarkable. This may emphasize the increased risk of AAD in NAFLD.","Hakan Duman, Hüseyin Durak, Emrah İpek, Handan Duman, Müjgan Ayşenur Şahin","Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD","2024Sep29","Humans; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Liver Cirrhosis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Aged; Dilatation, Pathologic; Aorta; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Echocardiography; Aspartate Aminotransferases"

Associated pathologies for EoE are similar to those with metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This study assesses whether an association exists between MASLD and EoE. We used National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2020 data to identify adult patients. ICD-10 codes were used to identify patients with MASLD and EoE. The relationship between MASLD and EoE was assessed by multivariate analysis after adjusting for confounding factors, such as patient demographics, hospital characteristics, Charlson comorbidity index, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease (CD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), smoking, alcohol use, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Out of 26 million patients, 4,820 had a diagnosis of EoE. The majority of the patients were between 18 and 44 years of age (47.82%), male (54.05%), had private insurance (50.1%), and were in the highest income quartile (29.25%). A higher incidence of MASLD was noted in the EoE group than those without (6.1% vs.2.9%, p<0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, MASLD had 2.38 times higher odds of having EoE (95% CI-1.82-3.11, p<0.001). Other factors noted to be associated with higher odds of EoE included younger age, Caucasian race, IBS, GERD, IBD, and CD. Our study reports a novel finding that MASLD and EoE are associated.

Mean, SD, independent samples t test and 1-way repeated analysis of variance were used to evaluate relevant data. A total of 62 children were included in this study. Overall, significant differences were observed in the weight-for-age z score (WAZ), height-for-age z score (HAZ) and body mass index-for-age z score (BAZ) at different time points ( P < 0.001). WAZ, HAZ and BAZ were not affected by PegIFN α-2b at 24 weeks of treatment (all P > 0.05). WAZ, HAZ and BAZ at the end of treatment and 48 weeks after treatment; WAZ at 96 weeks after treatment were lower than baseline levels (all P < 0.05). No statistical differences were found in HAZ and BAZ at 96 weeks after treatment compared with baseline. Thyroid dysfunction developed in 17.7% of children during the treatment. Thyroid dysfunction was transient and had no effect on growth. PegIFN α-2b has inhibitory effects on growth and can increase the incidence of thyroid dysfunction in young children with CHB. These effects are generally reversible with the cessation of therapy, although WAZ had not returned to baseline after 96 weeks of observation.","Qiufeng He, Chuangjie Mao, Zhili Chen, Fangfang Duan, Liang Huang, Rong Hu, Yang Deng, Jun Cheng, Song Yang, Yilan Zeng","The Pediatric infectious disease journal","2024Oct01",NA

Prediabetes is recognized as a condition that precedes the potential onset of diabetes. The objective of this research is to investigate how VAI and LAP are related to prediabetes among the adult population in the United States. Information from the 2007-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was scrutinized in a cross-sectional study. To evaluate the connection between VAI or LAP and the presence of prediabetes, both univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Threshold effect analysis and fitted smoothing curves were used to delve into the non-linear association between VAI or LAP and prediabetes. Additional analyses were performed on specific subgroups, along with tests to explore potential interactions. In general, 12,564 American adults were included. After full adjustment, prediabetes with VAI (OR: 1.128, 95% CI: 1.073-1.185) or LAP (OR: 1.006, 95% CI: 1.004-1.008) showed a positive correlation. Individuals in the 4th VAI quartile group faced a significant 61.9% elevated risk for prediabetes (OR: 1.619, 95% CI: 1.354-1.937) when contrasted to those in the 1st VAI quartile. Participants in the 4th LAP quartile group had a significant 116.4% elevated risk for prediabetes (OR: 2.164, 95% CI: 1.747-2.681) when contrasted to individuals of the 1st LAP quartile. Smooth curve fitting analysis revealed a nonlinear correlation of VAI or LAP and prediabetes, and threshold effect analysis was used to determine an inflection point of 4.090 for VAI and 68.168 for LAP. The values of VAI and LAP are positively associated with the prevalence of prediabetes. The VAI and LAP indices may be used as predictors of prediabetes.","Li-Ting Qiu, Ji-Dong Zhang, Bo-Yan Fan, Ling Li, Gui-Xiang Sun","PloS one","2024","Humans; Prediabetic State; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Middle Aged; United States; Nutrition Surveys; Lipid Accumulation Product; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Adiposity; Aged; Risk Factors"
"39348356","Diabetes prediction model based on GA-XGBoost and stacking ensemble algorithm.","Diabetes, as an incurable lifelong chronic disease, has profound and far-reaching effects on patients. Given this, early intervention is particularly crucial, as it can not only significantly improve the prognosis of patients but also provide valuable reference information for clinical treatment. This study selected the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) dataset, which is publicly available on the Kaggle platform, as the research object, aiming to provide a scientific basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes through advanced machine learning techniques. Firstly, the dataset was balanced using various sampling methods; secondly, a Stacking model based on GA-XGBoost (XGBoost model optimized by genetic algorithm) was constructed for the risk prediction of diabetes; finally, the interpretability of the model was deeply analyzed using Shapley values. The results show: (1) Random oversampling, ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTEENN were used for data balance processing, among which SMOTEENN showed better efficiency and effect in dealing with data imbalance. (2) The GA-XGBoost model optimized the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model through a genetic algorithm to improve the model's predictive accuracy. Combined with the better-performing LightGBM model and random forest model, a two-layer Stacking model was constructed. This model not only outperforms single machine learning models in predictive effect but also provides a new idea and method in the field of model integration. (3) Shapley value analysis identified features that have a significant impact on the prediction of diabetes, such as age and body mass index. This analysis not only enhances the transparency of the model but also provides more precise treatment decision support for doctors and patients. In summary, this study has not only improved the accuracy of predicting the risk of diabetes by adopting advanced machine learning techniques and model integration strategies but also provided a powerful tool for the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of diabetes.","Wenguang Li, Yan Peng, Ke Peng","PloS one","2024","Humans; Algorithms; Diabetes Mellitus; Machine Learning; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Risk Factors; Aged"

Specifically, we aimed to determine its association with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the progression of liver fibrosis. The study included 393 patients diagnosed with NAFLD after liver biopsy. The patients were divided into two distinct cohorts: a training cohort (N = 320) and a validation cohort (N = 73). The training cohort was further divided into four groups based on TyG-BMI quartiles. The clinical characteristics of the patients in each group were compared in detail, and the association between TyG-BMI and NASH, NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis was analyzed using multiple models. Additionally, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the predictive ability of TyG-BMI for NASH and fibrosis staging in patients with NAFLD. Patients with higher TyG-BMI values had a significantly higher prevalence of NASH, NAS ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis (all p < .05). TyG-BMI was an independent predictor of these diseases in both unadjusted and adjusted models (all p < .05). ROC curve analysis further revealed the excellent performance of TyG-BMI in predicting NASH, NAS ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The validation cohort yielded analogous results. Furthermore, we constructed three multivariate models of TyG-BMI in conjunction with elastography metrics, which demonstrated elevated diagnostic AUC values of 0.782, 0.792, 0.794, 0.785, 0.834, and 0.845, respectively. This study confirms a significant association between insulin resistance and NAFLD, including at-risk NASH and fibrosis staging, as assessed using the TyG-BMI index. TyG-BMI and its associated multivariate models can be valuable noninvasive indicators for NAFLD diagnosis, risk stratification, and disease course monitoring.","Fan Zhang, Yan Han, Yunfei Wu, Zuowei Bao, Guojun Zheng, Jianhong Liu, Wenjian Li","Annals of medicine","2024Dec","Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Middle Aged; Triglycerides; Liver Cirrhosis; Adult; Blood Glucose; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Liver; Disease Progression; Biopsy; Retrospective Studies"

To report the proportion of 3- and 4-year-old children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across 33 countries. Pooled analysis of data from 14 cross-sectional studies (July 2008 to September 2022) identified through systematic reviews and personal networks. Thirty-three countries of varying income levels across 6 geographical regions. Each study site needed to have at least 40 children aged 3.0 to 4.9 years with valid accelerometry and parent-/caregiver-reported screen time and sleep duration data. Data were analyzed from October 2022 to February 2023. Time spent in physical activity was assessed by reanalyzing accelerometry data using a harmonized data-processing protocol. Screen time and sleep duration were proxy reported by parents or caregivers. The proportion of children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity (≥180 min/d of total physical activity and ≥60 min/d of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity), screen time (≤1 h/d), and sleep duration (10-13 h/d) was estimated across countries and by World Bank income group and geographical region using meta-analysis.

"39348095","History of infertility and risk of endometrial cancer in the Women's Health Initiative.","Several studies have suggested an association between infertility and risk of endometrial cancer. However, most studies have evaluated this relationship in premenopausal people, yet the mean age of endometrial cancer is 60 years old, after the average age of menopause. Our study included Women's Health Initiative participants who self-reported whether they had a history of infertility. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between infertility and incident endometrial cancer. Given that all infertility diagnoses occurred prior to study enrollment, we conducted secondary analyses using logistic regression examining prevalent endometrial cancer cases diagnosed before study baseline. Approximately 18% of participants reported a history of infertility. No statistically significant association was observed between infertility and risk of incident endometrial cancer overall (incident cases=1622; hazard ratio [HR]=1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.99-1.26). While point estimates suggested an increase in risk of endometrial cancer among women with BMI ≥25 (HR=1.15; 95% CI=0.99-1.33), none of the associations were statistically significant. There was an association between history of infertility and prevalent endometrial cancer cases (odds ratio [OR]=1.19; 95% CI=1.06-1.34), with the strongest association for infertility diagnosis due to endometriosis (OR=2.42; 95% CI=1.83-3.19). In a population of postmenopausal participants, we observed a modest, but not statistically significant, association between overall infertility and incident endometrial cancer, with the suggestion of a higher risk among those with a BMI ≥25. Our findings highlight, as observed in previous studies, that risk factors for endometrial cancer may vary by body mass index.","Holly R Harris, Kathylynn Saboda, Cynthia A Thomson, Nazmus Saquib, Aladdin H Shadyab, Peter F Schnatz, Rogelio Robles-Morales, Lihong Qi, Denise J Roe, Leslie V Farland","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology","2024Sep30",NA
"39348029","Analysis of the impact on sexual function in early-onset overweight male patients with rectal cancer following robotic surgery.","The effect of radical resection of male rectal cancer on sexual function has been the focus of attention. Despite this, there remains a dearth of robust evidence regarding the influence of robotic radical resection of rectal cancer on postoperative sexual function, particularly in men diagnosed at an early age. This study aims to explore the implications of robotic radical resection of rectal cancer on sexual function in early-onset overweight male patients diagnosed with this disease. A retrospective analysis was performed on male patients under 50 years old and over 20 years old who were diagnosed with rectal cancer (cT1-3N0M0) and underwent surgical treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from May 2015 to August 2020. Sexual function was evaluated by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) test and scored at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The sexual function of traditional laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer (L-RE) and robotic radical resection of rectal cancer (R-RE) were compared. According to body mass index, L-RE and R-RE groups were further divided into normal body weight groups (LN-RE and RN-RE) and overweight groups (LO-RE and RO-RE), and the sexual function of each group was compared successively. Neither L-RE nor R-RE patients had significant differences in number of lymph nodes removed, tumour size, pathological TNM stage, or first exhaust time or time to eat liquids. The OS and DFS of the L-RE and R-RE groups, as well as the LO-RE and RO-RE groups, did not differ statistically after the logarithmic rank test (P > 0.05). IIEF scores in both the L-RE and R-RE groups declined sharply 1 month after surgery and then steadily increased. The R-RE group's IIEF scores significantly recovered in 6 months, compared to 12 months in the L-RE group. In comparison of subgroups, the results of sexual function in the LN-RE and RN-RE groups were similar to those in the L-RE and R-RE groups. Conversely, the RO-RE group showed slightly improved sexual function recovery than the LO-RE group 3 and 6 months post-surgery. 12 months after surgery, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. With similar long-term oncology outcomes, the robot-assisted surgical approach provided better protection of sexual function for men with early-onset rectal cancer, especially for those with a higher body mass index (BMI).","Yang Liu, Houqiong Ju, Yao Yao, Yuli Yuan, Tao Li, Yahang Liang, Hualin Liao, Taiyuan Li, Xiong Lei","Journal of robotic surgery","2024Sep30","Humans; Male; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Rectal Neoplasms; Overweight; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Adult; Postoperative Complications; Laparoscopy; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological"
"39347985","Oxidised phosphatidylcholine induces sarcolemmal ceramide accumulation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.","Intracellular ceramide accumulation in specific cellular compartments is a potential mechanism explaining muscle insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Muscle sarcolemmal ceramide accumulation negatively impacts insulin sensitivity in humans, but the mechanism explaining this localised accumulation is unknown. Previous reports revealed that circulating oxidised LDL is elevated in serum of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Oxidised phosphatidylcholine, which is present in oxidised LDL, has previously been linked to ceramide pathway activation, and could contribute to localised ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle. We hypothesised that oxidised phosphatidylcholine inversely correlates with insulin sensitivity in serum, and induces sarcolemmal ceramide accumulation and decreases insulin sensitivity in muscle. We used LC-MS/MS to quantify specific oxidised phosphatidylcholine species in serum from a cross-sectional study of 58 well-characterised individuals spanning the physiological range of insulin sensitivity. We also performed in vitro experiments in rat L6 myotubes interrogating the role of specific oxidised phosphatidylcholine species in promoting sarcolemmal ceramide accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. Human serum oxidised phosphatidylcholine levels are elevated in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity, and positively correlated with sarcolemmal C18:0 ceramide levels in skeletal muscle. Specific oxidised phosphatidylcholine species, particularly 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC), increase total ceramide and dihydroceramide and decrease total sphingomyelin in the sarcolemma of L6 myotubes by de novo ceramide synthesis and sphingomyelinase activation. POVPC also increases inflammatory signalling and causes insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. These data suggest that circulating oxidised phosphatidylcholine species promote ceramide accumulation and decrease insulin sensitivity in muscle, help explain localised sphingolipid accumulation and muscle inflammatory response, and highlight oxidised phosphatidylcholine species as potential targets to combat insulin resistance.","Karin A Zemski Berry, Amanda Garfield, Purevsuren Jambal, Simona Zarini, Leigh Perreault, Bryan C Bergman","Diabetologia","2024Sep30",NA
"39347961","Effect of preoperative liraglutide 3.0 mg on incidence of intraoperative adhesions in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.","Liraglutide has shown promising results in the field of bariatric surgery, preparing patients for surgery. However, chronic therapy is often correlated with gastrointestinal disorders, such as subclinical pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of intraoperative adhesions and post-operative complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with or without prior therapy with liraglutide. Clinical records of patients affected by obesity who underwent LSG between March 2017 and October 2022 were retrospectively reviewed using a prospectively maintained database. Patients were separated into two groups: those managed with preoperative liraglutide for 24 weeks prior to LSG, and those without prior medical therapy. Demographic data, operative time, intraoperative adhesions, and postoperative complications were reported and compared between two groups. Ninety-three patients underwent LSG without prior medical therapy, while 87 were treated with liraglutide before surgery. There were no significant differences in terms of gender, age, and comorbidities. After treatment with liraglutide, weight (117 vs 109 kg) and BMI (45 vs 42.2 kg/m2) were statistically lower than the group with no prior treatment to surgery. Thirty-two (37%) patients of the group treated with liraglutide had intraoperative adhesion vs nine (10%) patients of the control group (p < 0.005). There were no differences recorded between the two groups concerning post-operative complications. Liraglutide has introduced a new way to treat obesity, improving weight loss and comorbidities. Gastrointestinal disorders, such as subclinical pancreatitis, associated with GLP-1 analogue could explain the elevated incidence of intraoperative adhesions during bariatric surgery.","G Martines, C Giove, B Carlucci, A Dezi, C Ranieri, M T Rotelli, M De Fazio, G Tomasicchio","Surgical endoscopy","2024Sep30",NA
"39347957","Is prolonged operative time associated with postoperative complications in liver surgery? An international multicentre cohort study of 5424 patients.","The relation between operative time and postoperative complications in liver surgery is unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of operative time on the development of postoperative complications in patients who underwent minimally invasive or open liver resections of various anatomical extent and technical difficulty levels. In this retrospective cohort study, patients that underwent a right hemihepatectomy (RH), technically major resection (anatomically minor resection in segment 1, 4a, 7 or 8; TMR) or left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) between 2000 and 2022 were extracted from a multicenter database comprising the prospectively maintained databases of 31 centers in 13 countries. Minimally invasive procedures performed during the learning curve were omitted. Logistic regression models, performed separately for 9 different groups based on stratification by procedure type and allocated surgical approach, were used to assess the association between the fourth quartile of operative time (25% of patients with the longest operative time) and postoperative complications. Overall, 5424 patients were included: 1351 underwent RH (865 open, 373 laparoscopic and 113 robotic), 2821 TMR (1398 open, 1225 laparoscopic and 198 robotic), and 1252 LLS (241 open, 822 laparoscopic and 189 robotic). After adjusting for potential confounders (age, BMI, gender, ASA grade, previous abdominal surgery, disease type and extent, blood loss, Pringle, intraoperative transfusions and incidents), the fourth quartile of operative time, compared to the first three quartiles, was associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications after open, laparoscopic and robotic TMR (aOR 1.35, p = 0.031; aOR 1.74, p = 0.001 and aOR 3.11, p = 0.014, respectively), laparoscopic and robotic RH (aOR 1.98, p = 0.018 and aOR 3.28, p = 0.055, respectively) and solely laparoscopic LLS (aOR 1.69, p = 0.019).

"39347938","Metabolic syndrome is associated with reduced default mode network functional connectivity in young post-9/11 Veterans.","Metabolic syndrome is a collection of health factors that increases risk for cardiovascular disease. A condition of aging, metabolic syndrome is associated with reduced brain network integrity, including functional connectivity alterations among the default mode, regions vulnerable to neurodegeneration. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome is elevated in younger populations including post-9/11 Veterans and individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, but it is unclear whether metabolic syndrome affects brain function in earlier adulthood. Identifying early effects of metabolic syndrome on brain network integrity is critical, as these impacts could contribute to increased risk for cognitive disorders later in life for Veterans. The current study examined whether metabolic syndrome and its individual components were associated with default mode functional connectivity. We also explored the contribution of posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury on these metabolic syndrome-brain relationships. Post-9/11 Veterans with combat deployment history (95 with and 325 without metabolic syndrome) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to capture seed-based resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode. The metabolic syndrome group demonstrated reduced positive functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Data-driven analyses demonstrated that metabolic syndrome components, particularly cholesterol and central adiposity, were associated with widespread reductions in default mode network connectivity. Functional connectivity was also reduced in participants with metabolic syndrome but without current posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis and with traumatic brain injury history. These results suggest that metabolic syndrome disrupts resting-state functional connectivity decades earlier than prior work has shown.","Aubrey A Knoff, Madeleine K Nowak, Emily J Van Etten, V Carlota Andreu-Arasa, Michael Esterman, Elizabeth C Leritz, Francesca C Fortenbaugh, William P Milberg, Catherine B Fortier, David H Salat","Brain imaging and behavior","2024Sep30",NA

However, studies report that healthcare providers may not regularly discuss exercise with their patients. We evaluated clinical and sociodemographic determinants of receiving advice about exercise from healthcare providers among older breast cancer survivors (aged ≥65 years). We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries linked to the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) from 2008 to 2015. We included female breast cancer survivors, aged ≥65 years, who completed the MHOS survey ≥2 years after a breast cancer diagnosis in a modified Poisson regression to identify clinical and sociodemographic determinants of reportedly receiving advice about exercise from healthcare providers. The sample included 1,836 breast cancer survivors. The median age of the sample was 76 years (range: 72-81). Overall, 10.7% of the survivors were non-Hispanic Black, 10.1% were Hispanic, and 69.3% were non-Hispanic White. Only 52.3% reported receiving advice about exercise from a healthcare provider. Higher body mass index (BMI) and comorbid medical history that included diabetes, cardiovascular, or musculoskeletal disease were each associated with a higher likelihood of receiving exercise advice. Lower education levels, lower BMI, and never having been married were each associated with a lower likelihood of receiving exercise advice. Nearly half of breast cancer survivors aged ≥65 years did not report receiving exercise advice from a healthcare provider, suggesting interventions are needed to improve exercise counseling between providers and survivors, especially with women with lower educational attainment who have never been married.","Kaitlyn M Wojcik, Oliver W A Wilson, Dalya Kamil, Padma Sheila Rajagopal, Mara A Schonberg, Jinani Jayasekera","Breast cancer research and treatment","2024Sep30",NA
"39347661","Association of the modified creatinine index with quality of life in haemodialysis patients.","Aims/Background The evaluation of health-related quality of life in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis has garnered increasing attention. The modified creatinine index, a surrogate marker for muscle mass, has been linked to various clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between modified creatinine index and health-related quality of life in maintenance haemodialysis patients remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the association between modified creatinine index and health-related quality of life in individuals receiving maintenance haemodialysis. Methods This cross-sectional study included 217 maintenance haemodialysis patients. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument. Collected data included general patient information, laboratory results, and haemodialysis-related parameters. The modified creatinine index was calculated based on gender, age, single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V), and pre-dialysis serum creatinine levels. Multiple linear regression models and smooth curve fitting were used to investigate the relationship between modified creatinine index and health-related quality of life. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed to identify potential effect modifiers. Results The 217 maintenance haemodialysis patients had a mean age of 53.66±13.15 years and a median dialysis vintage of 39 (25-84) months; 120 (55.30%) were male. The mean health-related quality of life score was 55.76±10.33, and the mean modified creatinine index was 22.72±2.95 mg/kg/day. After adjusting for confounding factors, an increase in modified creatinine index was associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life (β=0.55, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.06, p = 0.033). No nonlinear relationship was identified between modified creatinine index and health-related quality of life by smooth curve fitting. Subgroup and interaction analyses indicated that the relationship between modified creatinine index and health-related quality of life was stable and not significantly influenced by age, gender, dialysis vintage, diabetes status, or body mass index (p > 0.05). Conclusion Modified creatinine index is positively correlated with health-related quality of life in maintenance haemodialysis patients, suggesting its potential utility in evaluating patient quality of life. Modified creatinine index could be clinically useful to improve the predictability of health-related quality of life in maintenance haemodialysis patients.","Jie Zeng, Yijing Wang, Hong Li, Hongying Wen","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)","2024Sep30","Humans; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Male; Female; Creatinine; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Biomarkers; Adult; Kidney Failure, Chronic"

However, its effect on the postoperative clinical outcomes of CRC remains controversial. This study aimed to elucidate the predictive value of sarcopenia for postoperative complications and survival in CRC patients. Methods This investigation retrospectively assessed the clinical data of 226 CRC patients who underwent radical resection at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University from January 2018 to December 2020. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the recommendations of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019, and patients were categorized into sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. Multivariate and univariate analyses were employed to assess the risk factors for postoperative complications. The Kaplan-Meier method and survival curve were used to analyze postoperative survival time. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate risk factors affecting the prognosis of CRC patients. Results This investigation included 226 patients, of which 68 were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Furthermore, it was revealed that sarcopenia was linked with older age (p < 0.001), low body mass index (p < 0.001), high prevalence of diabetes (p = 0.002), high cystatin level (p = 0.017), and low 3rd lumbar spine (L3) planar skeletal muscle index (p < 0.001), but was not related to the tumour stage or the gender. Moreover, sarcopenia was also correlated with increased occurrence of all postoperative complications (p = 0.050). The results of the multivariate analysis indicated that sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio (OR): 7.154; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.261-22.633; p = 0.017). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that sarcopenia patients had significantly lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (48.5% vs 59.5%; log-rank p = 0.033) and 5-year overall survival (OS) (57.4% vs 77.2%; log-rank p < 0.001) rates. Sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for poor DFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.404; p = 0.016) and OS (HR = 1.290; p = 0.021). Conclusion In CRC patients undergoing radical surgery, sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications.

Effective prediction and management of these complications are crucial to optimizing patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Methods This retrospective study analyzed PICC line insertion in 266 cancer patients implemented from January 2019 to December 2023 at a regional healthcare facility in China. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, we identified key factors influencing PICC line complications and developed a tailored nomogram for individual risk assessment. The efficacy of the model was compared with support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and gradient boosting machine (GBM) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) metrics. Results Factors such as body mass index (BMI), diabetic status, and age were found to be significant predictors of PICC line complications. The LASSO model demonstrated superior predictive capability (area under the curve, AUC = 0.79) over SVM (AUC = 0.40), random forest (AUC = 0.70), and GBM (AUC = 0.64). A tailored nomogram was developed for clinical use, enabling personalized risk evaluation. Conclusion The study underscores the utility of LASSO logistic regression in the personalized risk evaluation of PICC line complications, recommending its integration into clinical practice.

Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate to compare the baseline characters and PSG outcomes among the different centers. A total of 210 children with SCD from the three centers were included, with comparable sex, SCD genotypes, hemoglobin, hematocrit levels, and chronic transfusion. Children from the different centers exhibited variations in age (P < .001), BMI (P < .05), mean corpuscular volume (P < .05), and hydroxyurea use (P < .05) at the time of the PSG. Overall, the three centers showed significantly different PSG outcomes. Patients from UF had worse obstructive sleep apnea, oxygenation, and periodic leg movement events, together with lower hydroxyurea usage. While those from DUH showed higher hypoventilation and arousal indices. This multicenter study underscores variations in PSG outcomes among pediatric SCD patients at different centers in the Southeast United States.

"39347349","Assessing the Correlation Between Anthropometric Measurements and Bone Densitometry As Indicators of Bone Health in Adult Women in the Community.","Introduction Osteoporosis is one of the most prevalent bone diseases in humans and is a significant global public health issue since it is a risk factor for age-related fractures. Fracture risk is significantly influenced by bone mineral density (BMD). Recent research has revealed that there are various genetic and environmental variables that are similar between obesity and osteoporosis. The relationship between anthropometric measurements including weight, body surface area, height, and fat mass and BMD has been the subject of several studies. Decreased bone mass and a high risk of fracture have been linked to low BMI. Materials and methods A total of 370 female patients were included in this study. Anthropometric measures, such as weight and height, were taken in accordance with international standards. We measured the T-score, Speed of Sound (SOS) (in metres/s), Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA), and Stiffness Index (SI) of the participants using a portable quantitative ultrasonic bone densitometer with a gel-coupled system in a temperature-controlled environment (26 ± 1°C) to estimate the BMD. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, BMI, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) and BMD. Results In our study, we found that the population falling under the categories of Underweight and Obese have shown to have reduced BMD. There is an association between normal BMI and normal BMD. BMI can considerably affect one's risk of developing osteoporosis. Therefore, BMI and weight can be used to screen those who are at risk of having osteoporosis and its associated problems. We also observed an association between menopause and BMD measured by Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS). In the study population, post-menopausal women had a 4 times higher risk of osteoporosis than pre-menopausal women (OR = 4.46). Conclusion Calcaneal QUS is potentially helpful as a pre-screening tool for the evaluation of osteoporosis, although it must be based on device-specific cut-offs that have been tested in the populations for which they are intended to be used in a pre-screen or stratification methodology.","Rohan Chandanwale, Kshitija Chandanwale, Rutuja Chandanwale, Ajay Chandanwale","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

The primary objective was to evaluate the knee muscle-strengthening effect of Myostaal® liniment (Solumiks Herbaceuticals Limited, Mumbai, India) as an add-on to physiotherapy for 90 days compared to physiotherapy alone in participants with knee OA. Secondary objectives included assessing changes in the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, WOMAC Subscale scores, Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance, Single Leg Stance Test (SLST) duration, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, and the number of adverse events from baseline to Day 90 between the two groups. Seventy participants were randomly allocated to Group A (Myostaal® liniment plus physiotherapy) or Group B (physiotherapy alone) for 90 days, with Myostaal® liniment applied twice daily in Group A. Data were recorded in Case Report Forms (CRFs) and analyzed using parametric tests for within-group comparisons (one-way ANOVA or Friedman test) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test) for between-group comparisons, with significance set at p<0.05. The knee muscle strength (index knee) in Group A (test medication group) was significantly greater compared to Group B (standard treatment group) at Visit 3 (p<0.05; Day 60±3) and Visit 4 (p<0.001; Day 90±3). For the non-index (other) knee, a statistically significant increase in knee muscle strength was observed (p<0.001 at Day 90±3) solely in Group A. A notable reduction in total WOMAC score was seen in Group A from Visit 2 (p<0.01; Day 30±3) onward, compared to Visit 1 (Day 0). The scores at Visit 3 (p<0.001; Day 60±3) and Visit 4 (p<0.001; Day 90±3) were significantly lower than those at Visit 2 (Day 30±3). The local application of Myostaal® liniment through massage as an adjunct to a physiotherapy regimen, improved knee muscle strength in participants with knee OA, leading to an enhancement in joint functionality. Additionally, Myostaal® liniment provided superior pain relief as an add-on therapy.","Shailesh Deshpande, Vaishali Deshpande, Noopur Bhatt, Bhavin Dhanavade, Hemant Toshikane, Bhagawan G Kulkarni, Mukesh Chawda, Megha Nalawade, Rajmohan Seetharaman","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted for the first 100 consecutive robotic-assisted (RA) TKA (RA-TKA) patients between March 2022 and May 2023. All patients underwent preoperative leg CT scans utilizing a fully automated Cuvis Joint robot. Planning software determined implant sizes and bone resections to achieve a 180° hip-knee-ankle axis. A posterior-stabilized knee design was implanted during surgery by the same surgical team using a medial parapatellar approach. The study hypothesis was, that RA-TKA with preoperative CT scans and planning does not reduce soft tissue release incidence, comparing it with the historical control cohort using chi-square tests (P < 0.05 considered significant). Results The study consisted of 89 women and 11 males, with an average age of 65.3 ± 12 years. The average body mass index of the patients was 27.4 ± 5.2 kg/m2. Ninety-four individuals had varus knees, while six had valgus knee deformity. Varus deformity ranged between 7° and 18°, and valgus knee deformity ranged from 6° to 14° preoperatively. Twelve patients (12.77%) of 94 varus knees (versus historic control 29%, P-value = 0.0047) and one out of 6 (16.67%) valgus knees (versus historic control 84%, P < 0.0001) required posteromedial and posterolateral release for appropriate knee balance. Conclusions The study negates the null hypothesis and indicates that RA-TKA with preoperative CT scans and planning reduces the incidence of soft tissue releases to achieve a well-balanced knee.","Sanjay B Londhe, Supreet Bajwa, Ravi Teja Rudraraju, Ravi Shah, Kunal Patel, Suneet Velankar, Govindkumar Baranwal, Zara Namjoshi","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347269","Effects of High-Intensity Interval Walking on Cognitive and Physical Functions in Older Adults: A Randomized Pilot Study.","Walking is widely recognized as a prevalent form of daily exercise worldwide. However, fewer studies have explored the health outcomes of different intensities of walking exercise for older adults. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the effects of walking at different exercise intensities on body composition, emotions, cognition, and physical function among older adults. This study aimed to investigate the effects of walking at different exercise intensities on body composition, emotions, cognition, and physical function after eight weeks of group walking. Specifically, the study focused on the potential benefits of high-intensity interval walking (HIIW), exploring whether HIIW could have a more positive impact on the physical function and overall health of older adults compared to moderate-intensity continuous walking (MICW). Participants aged 65 years or older were randomly assigned to either HIIW (n=13, 85% HRmax and 55% HRmax, alternating every three minutes) or MICW (n=13, 70% HRmax), engaging in group walking exercises for 30 minutes three times a week. The pre-test and post-test evaluations included body composition, cognition, emotions, and physical function. The two-minute step test showed significant improvements over time (p<0.0001) and time-group interaction (p=0.004), and sit and reach showed significant changes over time (p<0.0001). The independent T-test showed significant differences between the HIIW and MICW groups (two-minute step test: t (24)=1.80, p=0.04; sit and reach test: t (19)=3.65, p<0.001) at post-measurement. Additionally, no significant differences were found in body composition (weight, p=0.74; body mass index (BMI), p=0.35; body fat mass, p=0.45; skeletal muscle mass (SMM), p=0.77), emotions (geriatric depression scale (GDS), p=0.79; quality of life (QOL), p=0.54; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, p=0.24), and cognitive function (CoSAS total score, p=0.25) between the HIIW and MICW groups after exercise. Grip strength, balance, 30-second chair stand, back scratch, and eight-foot up and go tests showed no significant effects in the time-group interaction. Regular HIIW exercise has positive effects on physical functions such as cardiorespiratory endurance and flexibility in older adults, indicating the potential for establishing a foundation for developing customized exercise programs in the future.","Xinxing Li, Ji-Won Seo, Jun-Hyun Bae, Shu Jiang, Yunho Sung, Parivash Jamrasi, So Young Ahn, Sanghyuk Han, Sowoon Kim, Chaewoon Kim, In-Yeong Jang, Nur Afiqah Binti Zulkifli, Hyejung Shin, Jai Young Choi, Sang Chul Park, Wook Song","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347252","Factors Influencing Prevalence, C-reactive Protein Levels, and Lymphocyte Counts in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients With Metabolic Syndrome.","Background This research examined the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lymphocyte counts in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comparing those with metabolic syndrome (MetS) to those without. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 100 consecutive COPD patients attending the outpatient wards at the Department of Medicine, Index Medical College, over 18 months. MetS was assessed using the International Diabetes Federation's guidelines. Pulmonary function tests such as spirometry were conducted following the European Respiratory Society's procedures, including measurements of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and the FEV1/FVC ratio. The Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease criteria were employed to evaluate COPD severity using post-bronchodilator FEV1. Results Our results indicated no significant differences in demographics, anthropometrics, or pulmonary function tests between COPD patients with MetS and those without. Average age, height, weight, body mass index, and blood pressure readings were similar between the groups, with no significant variations (p > 0.05). However, the total white blood cell count was significantly higher in the MetS group (9,214 ± 3,161.8 cells/µL) compared to the non-MetS group (6,657.8 ± 4,218 cells/µL, p = 0.001). CRP levels were markedly elevated in 90.9% of MetS patients compared to 21.4% of non-MetS patients. Pulmonary function tests showed no significant differences in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1 or FEV1/FVC ratios (p > 0.05). Conclusions The study found that individuals with COPD and MetS have elevated levels of CRP, suggesting that this association exacerbates systemic inflammation and metabolic issues. Furthermore, the risk of MetS in COPD patients did not significantly differ between smokers and non-smokers, indicating that MetS can affect all COPD patients regardless of smoking status. Additionally, more than half of the COPD patients had hypertension, a common comorbidity that reflects the oxidative stress and inflammatory processes shared by both conditions.","Binod Mahato, Shreya Nigoskar, Lingidi Jhansi Lakshmi, Doddigarla Zephy","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347227","Exploring Factors Influencing Stroke Risk: Insights From a Predictive Analysis.","Introduction Stroke is a serious medical condition characterized by the sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, resulting in the death of brain cells. It is a leading cause of long-term disability and mortality worldwide. Stroke has some associated risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable ones. As for non-modifiable risk factors, these are age, gender (men are more vulnerable), and family history of stroke. The controllable or adjustable risk factors include hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and insulin resistance. Methods In our study, we collected data from 229 patients which were originally collected for clinical purposes and were retrospectively analyzed. These data contain features such as sex and age, the presence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke history, and different blood sugar readings. These measurements include fasting blood sugar (FBS), postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), HbA1c%, and insulin levels (fasting and postprandial). Furthermore, cholesterol was also tested, such as total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Surprisingly, stroke was observed in 24 of the 205 patients. This contrast permits us to be concerned with the chance of the association between stroke and insulin levels. Given the imbalanced nature of our outcome variable (stroke occurrence), the primary analytical method will be logistic regression. Results In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between high insulin levels (both fasting and postprandial) and the occurrence of stroke within a dataset of 229 patients. Out of the 229 included cases, 102 individuals were female (44.5%) and 127 individuals were male (55.5%). Twenty-four cases have ischemic heart disease (10.5%). Among the analyzed cases, 24 individuals have a history of stroke. The average age of the sample is approximately 57 years ± 14.87. There was no significant difference between the males and females in most of the descriptive statistics. However, females experienced significantly higher levels of postprandial glucose level and significantly lower levels of postprandial insulin. According to our predictive model, we found that an increase in fasting insulin levels was linked to a lower risk of stroke occurrence. On the other hand, increasing insulin postprandial levels and age were associated with an increased risk of stroke. Conclusion Our study identified age, fasting insulin, and postprandial insulin as key factors influencing stroke risk. Higher fasting insulin levels were associated with reduced risk, while increased postprandial insulin and age were linked to higher risk. Blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides had minor effects. Notably, higher total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were slightly associated with lower stroke occurrence. Further research with larger samples is needed for validation.","Venkatram Murugesan, Murugesan Natesan, Vahidha Sulthana, Pranav R Donapaty","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347191","Knowledge and Perception of Anti-obesity Medications Among Primary Healthcare Center Visitors in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2024: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study.","Obesity is a significant public health concern globally, with an alarming prevalence in Saudi Arabia. While anti-obesity medications (AOMs) offer a pharmacological approach to weight management, their awareness and perception remain underexplored. To assess the knowledge, perception, and prevalence of AOM usage among primary healthcare visitors in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 361 primary healthcare visitors aged 18 to 60 in Jeddah. Data on demographics, knowledge, and usage of AOMs were collected using a structured online questionnaire. The study employed a multistage sampling technique to ensure a representative sample. Statistical analyses included median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. Knowledge differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. A pilot study with 10% of the sample was conducted to refine the questionnaire. Approval from the Ethics Committee was obtained, and participants provided informed consent. The study found a median knowledge score of 44.4% regarding AOMs. Significant associations were noted between higher knowledge levels and educational attainment (p=0.008), healthcare worker status (p=0.009), monthly income (p=0.029), and previous use of weight loss medications (p<0.001). The most commonly used AOM was Ozempic (13.0%). Social media emerged as the most common source of information, positively correlating with higher knowledge levels (p=0.006). Additionally, 72.0% of participants were aware that not everyone is suitable for AOMs, and 78.9% understood that these medications are more effective when combined with diet and exercise. Side effects awareness varied, with 32.1% recognizing nausea and vomiting and 55.4% aware of the increased risks of pancreatitis. The study reveals that primary healthcare visitors in Jeddah have a moderate level of knowledge about AOMs, with significant differences based on education, professional status, and sources of information. To improve awareness and appropriate use of AOMs, targeted educational interventions should be implemented. These interventions could help reduce obesity-related health issues by ensuring that individuals are well-informed about the benefits and risks of AOMs.","Renad M Khalaf, Hani A Alghamdi","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347162","A Study of Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Premenopausal Women With Female Pattern Hair Loss: A Case-Control Study.","Background and objective Female pattern hair loss (FPHL), also known as androgenetic alopecia (AGA), is a condition where the hair follicles of genetically susceptible women gradually shrink and become thinner, leading to hair loss in a particular pattern. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a collection of conditions that co-occur, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. This study aims to determine the prevalence of MS in premenopausal women in patients with FPHL. Methods and materials We conducted a case-control, hospital-based observational study at our institution for a period of two years, which included 62 patients, with 31 cases (patients with FPHL) and 31 controls (patients without FPHL). Results In some cases, the mean age was 29.81 years, while in controls, it was 28.84 years. The mean waist circumference (WC) in cases was 81.9 +/- 11.75 cm, and in controls, it was 72.65 +/- 8.86 cm, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.001. In some cases, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.28 +/- 4.09 kg/m2, and in controls, it was 24.52 +/- 2.78 kg/m2, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.013. Between cases and controls, there was no significant difference in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting triglyceride levels, fasting HDL, and fasting insulin levels. Conclusion The study found a significant association between WC and BMI in patients with FPHL in premenopausal women.

"39347152","Analysis of Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Prospective Observational Study.","Objective This prospective observational study aimed to investigate the prevalence, acquired risk factors, and treatment outcomes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at a tertiary care center in India. Materials and methods Conducted from 2022 to 2024, the study included 100 patients diagnosed with lower extremity DVT. The study subjects included patients visiting the general surgery, vascular surgery, surgical gastroenterology, general medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology departments with symptoms suggestive of DVT. The primary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy as well as to assess the various acquired risk factors for DVT. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical and biochemical evaluations, including venous Doppler ultrasound, and were treated based on their clinical presentations. The study's primary end outcome was early recanalization rates on day 14 post-initiation of treatment and occurrence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Secondary outcome measures included duration of hospital stay, time taken to return to work and early complications. Results The highest incidence of DVT was in individuals in their forties, with a mean age of 44.84+/-11.71 years and a female preponderance of 58% (n=58). Key acquired risk factors identified included hypertension (25%; n=25), diabetes mellitus (20%; n=20), obesity (16%; n=16), and smoking (34%; n=34). Obesity (16%; n=16), a history of DVT (25%; n=25), trauma/immobilization (9%; n=9), pregnancy (10%; n=10), smoking (34%; n=34), and cancer (20%; n=20) were also identified as important acquired risk factors contributing to the occurrence of DVT. Amongst the study participants, 28% (n=28) had femoro-popliteal segment involvement, 36% (n=36) had calf vein thrombosis, and the remaining 36% (n=36) showed femoro-iliac segment thrombosis. Conventional anticoagulation was administered to 69% (n=69) of patients, while 31% (n=31) received thrombolytic therapy. Both treatments showed similar recanalization rates, but thrombolytic therapy was associated with a longer hospital stay (8.61+/-1.65 days; p=0.024; p<0.05) and return to work period (14.65+/-2.31 days; p=0.012; p<0.05). Post-thrombotic syndrome was less common in the thrombolytic therapy group (3%; n=3). Three patients died in the study, with the cause being pulmonary embolism. The descriptive statistics were computed to delineate the study sample. After completion of data collection, data analysis was achieved using SPSS for Windows, Version 16 (Released 2007; SPSS Inc., Chicago, United States), and the correlations sought after were achieved using the chi-square test of significance. Conclusion The study underscores the importance of recognizing and managing acquired risk factors for DVT, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality. Understanding these factors and employing effective treatment strategies are crucial for better management and prevention of DVT, enhancing patient outcomes.","Iqbal M Ali, Vijay Sai Reddy M, Varun Shetty","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347131","Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Patients With Psoriasis Vulgaris: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.","Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin condition that affects 1-3% of the global population. Increasing evidence suggests a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among individuals with psoriasis. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of MetS in patients with psoriasis and compare the findings with existing literature. Methods This cross-sectional, hospital-based study included 311 patients with psoriasis. Data were retrospectively collected from hospital records. Results The study included 311 patients with psoriasis (144 females and 167 males), with a mean age of 41.6 years (range 18-87). The mean BMI was 27.13 ± 5.29 kg/m², and the average waist circumference was 93 cm. Mean fasting blood sugar levels were 100 mg/dL, mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was 44 mg/dL, and mean triglycerides were 132 mg/dL. MetS was diagnosed in 60 patients (19.3%). Patients with MetS had significantly higher mean waist circumference, higher rates of hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, and lower mean HDL levels (p < 0.05). There was no significant association between MetS and psoriasis severity, disease duration, family history, smoking, or alcohol consumption habits. Conclusions In this study, the prevalence of MetS among patients with psoriasis was 19.3%. MetS prevalence was not linked to smoking status, alcohol consumption, family history of psoriasis, disease duration, or severity. It is crucial for dermatologists treating psoriasis patients to be aware of MetS, its components, and associated cardiovascular risks.","Fatma Etgü, Emine Dervis","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39347124","Circulating Chemerin Levels in Obese and Non-obese Individuals and Its Association With Obesity in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease.","Introduction The prevalence of obesity and related disorders is rapidly rising due to altered food habits, sedentary lifestyles and stress. Adipose tissue releases various hormones known as adipokines; one example is chemerin, which is primarily expressed by hepatocytes, adipocytes, and immune cells. Adipokine dysregulation in obesity initiates the cascade of inflammation and insulin resistance that leads to various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MS), and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Aim The aim of our research is to determine serum chemerin levels in obese and non-obese individuals and to estimate the prevalence of MAFLD in obesity. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at SRM Medical College Hospital & Research Centre, Tamil Nadu from August 2023 to December 2023. The study group comprised 45 obese and 45 non-obese individuals above 18 years of age. New MAFLD diagnostic criteria and FLI (Fatty Liver Index) formula were used to stratify the cohort. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise questionnaire was used to assess physical activity levels. Visceral fat was assessed using a body composition analyzer. Student's t-test and ANOVA were used to compare the difference in mean levels across the groups. Pearson's correlation was used to correlate the analyzed parameters. Results Among our obese study participants, nearly 50% reported following a sedentary lifestyle. The prevalence of MAFLD in our obese study group was 44% whereas the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty disease was found to be only 33%. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, triglycerides (TG) and chemerin levels were found to vary significantly between the two groups. However, our study did not reveal the association of chemerin with MAFLD, BMI, or visceral fat in obesity. A significant difference in BMI, and visceral fat was observed across groups stratified by their physical activity levels assessed using the Godin leisure questionnaire. Conclusion Our study highlights the effect of physical activity on adipose tissue distribution and metabolic health and does not reveal any significant association of chemerin with MAFLD, BMI, or visceral fat in obesity. Nearly half of the studied obese individuals lead sedentary lifestyles, which highlights the importance of promoting physical activity in the prevention of obesity and related metabolic dysfunction. To validate these findings, future research should involve larger, diverse cohorts and include longitudinal data to track shifts in chemerin levels over time and their impact on metabolic health.","Aravindraj R, Renuka P, Vinodhini Vm, Meenakshi Sundari Sn","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39346803","Efficacy of Closed-Incision Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in Reducing Postoperative Complications in Breast Reconstruction After Radiotherapy: A Propensity Score Analysis.","Implant-based breast reconstruction following radiotherapy can lead to significant postoperative complications. Closed-incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) has emerged as a potential intervention to reduce these complications. To assess the effectiveness of ciNPWT in reducing postoperative complications in patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction after radiotherapy. A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted, including patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy and radiotherapy between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022. We utilized a procedure-level analysis model with patients contributing distinct observations for multiple procedures. Our primary outcome measures included fluid collection, infection, and wound complications. Propensity score analysis was employed to adjust for potential confounders, such as BMI, smoking history, and diabetes history, creating a balanced comparison between the ciNPWT-treated and untreated groups. In our study of 301 breast reconstructions postradiotherapy from 2015 to 2022, encompassing 218 unique patients, we found significant benefits of ciNPWT. During an average of 2.2-year follow-up, the ciNPWT group demonstrated no infections, contrasting with a 10.4% rate in the non-ciNPWT group (P < .0001). Wound complications were also significantly lower in the ciNPWT group (1.9% vs 11.2%; P = .00848). Demographic differences were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weights. The findings suggest ciNPWT's promising role in enhancing postoperative outcomes in breast reconstruction postradiotherapy. Our study suggests that the use of ciNPWT in implant-based breast reconstruction postradiotherapy can potentially reduce postoperative complications. This intervention can improve patient outcomes and may offer cost-saving benefits in the long run.","Khaled O Alameddine, Cristina A Salinas, Maria Yan, Jorys Martinez-Jorge, Aparna Vijayasekaran, Nho V Tran, Christin A Harless","Aesthetic surgery journal.

We employed multiple logistic regression analysis to investigate the relationship between WWI and risk of gynecologic cancers. Subsequent subgroup analyses were performed on specific populations of interest. A restricted cubic spline model was used to explore potential non-linear relationships. Additionally, the effectiveness of WWI in predicting sarcopenia was assessed through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. K-fold cross-validation was applied for model assessment. Among the 4,144 participants, 98 self-reported having gynecologic cancers. In the fully adjusted model, WWI was significantly associated with the prevalence of gynecologic cancers (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.88, p = 0.0344). Our findings indicate a linear positive association between WWI and the risk of gynecologic cancers. Subgroup analysis revealed that WWI had the strongest association with cervical cancer (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 0.97-2.18, p = 0.0354) and endometrial cancer (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 0.81-2.39, p = 0.0142). No significant association was found between WWI and the risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.48-2.72, p = 0.5359). Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed a linear relationship between WWI and the risk of cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that WWI had superior predictive capability for gynecologic cancers. Elevated levels of WWI were significantly associated with an increased risk of gynecologic cancers in American women, displaying a stronger association than other obesity markers. Therefore, WWI may serve as a distinct and valuable biomarker for assessing the risk of gynecologic cancers, particularly cervical and endometrial cancers.","Liyuan Fang, Xiaotong Li, Yuhang Fang, Yan Wang, Runxi Wang, Yi Xie, Ying Zhang","Frontiers in nutrition","2024",NA
"39346643","Assessing the impact of dietary choices on fiber deficiency: insights from the 2017-2020 Polish national adult nutrition survey.","Dietary fiber is a key component of a healthy diet, associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, chronic inflammation, or depression. The aim of the study was to perform an in-depth analysis of dietary fiber intake in the Polish population, taking account of the consumption of groups of products that are fiber sources and identify any age-related differences in the dietary fiber intake of the subjects. We analyzed data obtained from two representative cross-sectional studies on the diet and nutritional status of adult Polish residents including the total of 4,000 individuals aged 19 years and more. Two 24-h recalls were used per individual to assess the diet using the computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) technique. Total fiber content and fiber contained in cereal products, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds were calculated. Fiber intake was compared to the recommendations: 25 g/d for adults up to 65 years of age and 20 g/d for those aged 66 years and older. All statistical analyses, including the Pearson's chi-squared test, the Student's t-test, and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), were conducted using STATISTICA™ version 13.3, with the results being adjusted for demographic distribution biases to enhance the representativeness. The average daily fiber intake was 17.83 ± 0.14 g/day (78% of the recommended intake), with 20.5% of respondents meeting the requirement. More men than women (27.05% vs. 14.3%;) met the requirement and men were characterized by a higher average intake (19.34 ± 0.20 g/day) than women (16.43 ± 0.19 g/day). The main fiber sources were cereals (44.1%), vegetables (23.6%), and fruits (16.0%). As regards men, the sources included refined bread (25.8%), vegetables (23.1%), and fruits (10.2%) and for women, they were vegetables (24.0%), fruits (17.2%), and refined bread (16.3%). Although refined bread is not recommended as a primary fiber source due to its lower fiber content compared to whole grain bread, its high consumption significantly contributed to the total fiber intake. The prevalence of widespread dietary fiber deficiency calls for the intensification of educational efforts that address the health advantages and sources of dietary fiber, as well as methods for its inclusion in daily meals.","Alicja Kucharska, Beata Irena Sińska, Mariusz Panczyk, Piotr Samel-Kowalik, Dorota Szostak-Węgierek, Filip Raciborski, Bolesław Samoliński, Iwona Traczyk","Frontiers in nutrition","2024",NA

Therefore, this study aims to examine the mediating role of CRF in the relationship between PA and PL in this demographic. This cross-sectional study involved 1,360 children aged 8-12 (mean age = 10.00, SD = 1.41 years) from 85 higher secondary schools in South Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected during the 2020-2021 academic year using the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy-2 (CAPL-2) protocol to assess physical activity (PA), Body Mass Index (BMI), and PL levels. CRF was measured using the PACER (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) test. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, Chi-squared tests, and Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) were used for age and sex-specific CAPL-2 scoring. Associations among components were evaluated through Pearson's correlation, multivariate logistic regression, and mediation analyses. The study revealed that boys had significantly higher scores in CRF, PA, and PL across all age groups compared to girls (p < 0.001), with boys' scores being 20%, 10%, and 14% higher, respectively, than those of girls. Conversely, overweight children showed significantly reduced PA and PL levels (p < 0.001). An inverse correlation was found between BMI and CRF (r 2 linear = 0.022; quadratic = 0.028). CRF scores had significant negative correlations BMI (r = -0.143) and positive associations with MVPA, PA, DB, and PL (r ranging from 0.241 to 0.624). CRF was observed to partially mediate the association between MVPA and PL. The direct impact of PA on PL was significant and meaningful (β = 0.002, p < .001). Additionally, the indirect effect of PA on PL through CRF was also significant (β = 0.001, p < .001), indicating that CRF serves as an important mediator in this relationship. The combined total effect of PA on PL, which includes both direct and mediated pathways, was robust and highly significant (β = 0.003, p < .001). The study revealed a strong positive correlation between CRF, PA, and PL, but a negative one with BMI in South Punjab children aged 8-12. Notably, CRF and PA emerged as significant predictors of PL levels in this population. Consequently, interventions that are both systematic and targeted towards improving these factors should be implemented as strategies to enhance children's PL levels and promote physically active behaviors.","Syed Ghufran Hadier, Liu Yinghai, Liu Long, Syed Danish Hamdani, Syed Muhammad Zeeshan Haider Hamdani","Frontiers in pediatrics","2024",NA
"39346637","Combination effects of environmental tobacco smoke exposure and nutrients supplement during pregnancy on obesity in Chinese preschool children.","This study aimed to explore the combination effects of prenatal exposure to environment tobacco smoke (ETS) and nutrients supplement during pregnancy on childhood obesity in preschoolers. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 58,814 child-mother dyads from 235 kindergartens in Longhua District of Shenzhen, China in 2021. A self-administered structured questionnaire was completed by mothers to collect socio-demographic characteristics, prenatal ETS exposure, and nutrients supplement in pregnancy, and preschoolers' heights and weights were measured at the same time. After controlling for potential confounding variables, logistic regression models and cross-analyses were used to examine the independent and combination effects of maternal prenatal ETS exposure and nutrients supplementation during pregnancy on obesity in preschool children. The results of our study showed that prenatal ETS exposure increased the risk of childhood obesity (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.11-1.34) in preschoolers. In addition, risk of childhood obesity was significantly higher when mothers didn't take supplements of multivitamins (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05-1.20), folic acid (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.10-1.37) and iron (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.19) during pregnancy. The cross-over analysis showed that the combination of prenatal ETS exposure with mothers taking no multivitamins (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.21-1.62), no folic acid (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12-2.14) and no iron (AOR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.19-1.59) during pregnancy also increased the risk of obesity among Chinese preschoolers. We also discovered additive interactive effects between prenatal ETS exposure and no maternal multivitamin, folic acid and iron supplementation in pregnancy on the risk of obesity in preschoolers. The combination of prenatal exposure to ETS with no supplementation of these nutrients might jointly increase the risk of childhood obesity. Public health interventions are needed to reduce prenatal exposure to ETS and to encourage mothers to take appropriate multivitamin, folic acid and iron supplements during pregnancy.","Wen-Xuan Zhang, Esben Strodl, Wei-Kang Yang, Xiao-Na Yin, Guo-Min Wen, Deng-Li Sun, Dan-Xia Xian, Ya-Fen Zhao, Wei-Qing Chen","Frontiers in pediatrics","2024",NA

A convenience sampling method was used to select 372 older adult patients with chronic diseases from five tertiary hospitals in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. General demographic information was collected using a questionnaire, and self-efficacy, self-care ability, and disability were assessed using standardized scales. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0, and the PROCESS macro was employed to test the mediating effect of self-efficacy. The mean score for self-efficacy was 26.09 ± 7.20, for self-care ability was 113.19 ± 23.31, and for disability was 154.19 ± 29.32. Self-efficacy was positively correlated with self-care ability (r = 0.73, p < 0.001. and negatively correlated with disability (r = -0.84, p < 0.001. and self-care ability and disability (r = -0.91, p < 0.001.. The indirect effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between self-care ability and level of disability was -0.03 (95% CI -0.08 to -0.04), accounting for 16.67% of the total effect. Self-efficacy partially mediates the relationship between self-care ability and disability in older adult patients with chronic conditions.

We selected individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 2007 to 2016 and used logistic regression analyses, subgroup analyses, and dose-response curves to assess the associations between the WWI index and the prevalence of depression in older hypertensive patients with age, sex, and BMI. A total of 4,228 participants aged ≥60 years with hypertension were included in our study; 364 patients were assessed for depression. After correction for confounders, each unit increase in WWI increased the risk of depression in older hypertensive patients by 19% (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.43). Dose-response curves showed that the WWI index was positively associated with the prevalence of depression in older hypertensive patients when the WWI index was ≥11.6. Based on subgroup analyses, this association was particularly pronounced in individuals ≥70 years of age, women, and individuals with a BMI of 25 or greater. Higher WWI scores were positively associated with the prevalence of depression in older hypertensive patients and correlated with gender, age and BMI.

"39346576","Inflammatory Manifestations Associated With Gut Dysbiosis in Alzheimer's Disease.","Recent studies strongly suggest that gut microbiome can influence brain functions and contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, reported changes in the gut microbiomes in AD patients from different countries are not similar, and more research is needed to reveal the relationships between human microbiomes and AD in diverse ethnic populations. There is also an assumption that microbiome-associated peripheral inflammation might drive the development of sporadic AD. This cross-sectional study is aimed at analyzing the gut microbial profile and exploring potential associations with blood cytokines and some clinical parameters among individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's in Kazakhstan. Consistent with previous studies, we have found that the microbial landscape in AD reveals specific alterations in the gut microbiome. Specifically, the AD patient group showed a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. The differential abundance analysis highlighted a dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of AD patients, marked by a reduced presence of Bifidobacterium, particularly B. breve. In our study, AD patients' altered gut microbiota composition notably features an increased presence of Pseudomonadota like Phyllobacterium and inflammatory bacteria such as Synergistetes and the Christensenellaceae family. The metabolic profiling of the AD microbiome reveals a predominant presence of pathways related to sugar, carrier molecules, tetrapyrrole, pyrimidine biosynthesis, and nucleic acid processing. This analysis also highlighted a marked reduction in SCFA, carbohydrate, polysaccharide, polyamine, and myo-inositol degradation pathways. The increases in the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-12p40, TNF-β, MCP-1, IL-2, and IL-12p70 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 were observed in AD patients. Key variables driving the separation of AD and controls include inflammatory markers (IL-1a and IL-8), growth factors (EGF), lipids (LDL), BMI, and gut microbes, like genus Tyzzerella and Turicibacter and species Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides eggerthii. We have also demonstrated that almost all cytokines strongly correlate with serum adiponectin levels and specific microbial taxa in AD patients. Thus, our findings identify potential microbial and inflammatory signatures in an ethnically distinct cohort of AD patients. These could serve as AD biomarkers and microbiota-based therapeutic targets for treating AD.","Samat Kozhakhmetov, Aiym Kaiyrlykyzy, Zharkyn Jarmukhanov, Elizaveta Vinogradova, Gulnaz Zholdasbekova, Dinara Alzhanova, Jeanette Kunz, Almagul Kushugulova, Sholpan Askarova","International journal of Alzheimer's disease","2024",NA

Arterial stiffness is one of the most important predictors and pathogenetic mechanisms of CVD development. The aim of our study was to evaluate the predictive differences of age-related and age-independent (universal) cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) reference values for detecting increased arterial stiffness in individuals without CVD. The study included 600 patients (43% men and 57% women, mean age 36.0 ± 18.3 years). All the patients underwent anthropometric measurements with obesity markers evaluation, assessment of arterial stiffness by sphygmomanometry. To create predictive models, we used universal and age-related CAVI thresholds: ≥ 9.0 (CAVI≥ 9) and CAVIAge according to the ""Consensus of Russian experts on the evaluation of arterial stiffness in clinical practice"". In the < 50 years group, both the CAVIAge and CAVI≥ 9 models were significant (CAVIAge: b = 4.8, standard error b (st.err.b) = 0.27, P < 0.001; CAVI≥ 9: b = 3.2, st.err.b = 1.6, P < 0.001). The CAVIAge model demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity (> 70%) compared to the CAVI≥ 9 model (sensitivity 62%, specificity 58%). In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the CAVIAge model had a significantly higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.802 than the CAVI≥ 9 model: AUC = 0.674. In the ≥ 50 years group, both models were significant: CAVIAge (b = 2.6, st.err.b = 1.13, P < 0.001) and CAVI≥ 9 (b = 5.3, st.err.b = 0.94, P < 0.001).

A methodological observational design was conducted and followed standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of Mini-OAKHQOL into Saudi Arabic. Two hundred and eight primary OA knee and/or hip male participants aged between 45 and 80 years with a mean age of 58.65 ± 13.8 years and a BMI of 29.5 ± 1.2 kg/m2 were included and performed the stages of translation to target Arabic language (forward T1 and T2), synthesized an Arabic draft (T12), then back-translated to English (BT1 and BT2), followed by expert committee review to rectify the deficiencies leading to a prefinal stage involving a pilot test on native Arabic speakers, thereby finalized a final Arabic version. The Arabic Mini-OAKHQOL, Arabic Short Form 12 (SF12), and visual analog scale (VAS) were administered to analyze internal consistency (IC), test-retest reliability at baseline as well as one week later (up to the 10th day). The construct validity was tested using Spearman's rank correlation, and factor analysis was done to establish a five-factor fit model. Homogeneity was determined using principal component analysis (PCA). Floor and ceiling effects calculated in percentages. The Arabic Mini-OAKHQOL showed an excellent Cronbach's alpha of the overall scale (α = 0.931) for its internal consistency and an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.947 for its retest reliability, with a high response rate of 93.75%. The construct validity of this scale was good with Ar-SF12 and VAS pain. A five-factor model fit was considered acceptable, and factor loading for each item found within the permissible limits confirmed the factorial validity. None of the items, dimensions, or overall scale showed either a floor or ceiling effect.

Additionally, in boys, overweight/obese status was found to be a significant predictor of ACL injury (HR = 2.61 [95% CI, 1.60-4.26]). Furthermore, among 9- to 13-year-old girls, advanced Tanner stage was a strong predictor of injury risk (HR = 2.43 [95% CI, 1.10-5.36]). Age, time engaged in vigorous activity, overweight/obese status, and advanced Tanner stage were associated with an increased risk of ACL injury in young adults and adolescents. Further research with follow-up data will help complement this study and continue to highlight the risk factors associated with ACL reconstruction in adolescents and young adults.","Christine M Etzel, Ozair Meghani, Brett D Owens, Mininder S Kocher, Alison E Field","Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine","2024Sep",NA
"39345911","The Application of Nanotechnology for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Endocrine Disorders: A Review of Current Trends, Toxicology and Future Perspective.","The endocrine system regulates many biological systems, and disruptions may result in disorders, such as diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Cushing's syndrome, and obesity. The total incidence of endocrine illnesses was found to be 47.4%, excluding type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a significant frequency of newly diagnosed endocrine disorders. Nanotechnology manipulates particles at the atomic and molecular levels, opening up new paths for studying disease etiology and therapeutic alternatives. The goal of using nanomaterials in the treatment of endocrine illnesses is to create endogenous nano-biosensors that can detect even modest changes in hormone levels and react spontaneously to restore normal function. The size and surface characteristics of nanoparticles enhances the sensitivity in nano-sensors and are functionalized for targeted drug delivery. Nano-sized carriers composed of lipids, polymers, carbon, or metals have been shown to work much better than standard drug delivery methods. Nanoparticles (NPs) offer various advantages over current methods for diagnosing and treating endocrine disorders, acting as hydrogels for insulin delivery and wound healing. Incorporating selenium NPs into inorganic nanoparticles enhances their bioactivity and targeted delivery. Gold NPs show a promising precise insulin delivery. Mesoporous silica NPs maintain glycemic level effectively and lipid and polymeric NPs protect drugs from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have become popular in thyroid surgeries. These characteristics make nanoparticles valuable for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic systems. NP-based medicines have been thoroughly researched in order to identify the beginning point for the creation of theranostics, which may function in two ways: as imaging agents or therapeutics. The study posits that nanotechnology bridges diagnostics and therapies, potentially revolutionizing endocrine disorder treatments. This review delves into nanotechnology techniques, emphasizing their applications in diagnosing and treating diabetes mellitus.","Yan Yan, Hanqing Cai, Maoguang Yang","International journal of nanomedicine","2024","Humans; Endocrine System Diseases; Nanotechnology; Nanomedicine; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Nanoparticles"
"39345904","Association between Metabolic Syndrome and Musculoskeletal Status: A Cross-Sectional Study of NHANES.","The metabolic effects of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on musculoskeletal metabolism are controversial. This study explored the effect of MetS on bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle quality index (MQI). Data from the NHANES database from 2011 to 2014 were extracted, and nonpregnant participants aged 45-59 years were included. The included data were first weighted by complex sampling, and then, the effect of MetS on BMD and MQI was analyzed using multifactorial linear regression. We then performed a stratified analysis by gender and BMI classification. Moreover, a mediation analysis of MetS on BMD was conducted, with MQI as a mediating variable. A propensity score matching analysis method with a complex sampling design was additionally performed to verify the stability of the results. A total of 1943 participants were eventually included. After adjusting for covariates, the results of linear regression show that MetS is associated with elevated pelvic BMD (beta = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.06; P=0.02) and reduced MQI, especially arm MQI (beta = -1.02; 95% CI = -1.27, -0.77; P < 0.0001). MetS is more associated with BMD in women, MQI in normal or heavyweight, and BMD in lightweight, according to stratified analysis. MQI explains the indirect effect of MetS on BMD (beta = 0.007; 95% CI = 0.003, 0.010). This study provides evidence that MetS elevates BMD and reduces MQI, and further, that there is a mediating effect of MQI on elevated BMD.","Yue Shi, Shuhan Li, Xiaolong Xie, Yue Feng","International journal of endocrinology","2024",NA
"39345888","Inspiratory muscle strength training to improve cardiometabolic health in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: protocol for the diabetes inspiratory training clinical trial.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, chronic metabolic disease that carries with it a high prevalence of comorbid conditions, making T2DM one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. Traditional lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) can counter some adverse effects of T2DM, however, participation in these activities is low with reasons ranging from physical discomfort to lack of time. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel management strategies that effectively reduce cardiometabolic disease risk and address barriers to adherence. High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a time-efficient and simple breathing exercise that significantly reduces systolic and diastolic BP and improves vascular endothelial function in adults with above-normal blood pressure. Herein we describe the study protocol for a randomized clinical trial to determine the effects of a 6-week IMST regimen on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in adults with T2DM. Our primary outcome measures include fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and insulin resistance utilizing homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcome measures include resting systolic BP and endothelium-dependent dilation. Further, we will collect plasma for exploratory proteomic analyses. This trial seeks to establish the cardiometabolic effects of 6 weeks of high-resistance IMST in patients with T2DM.","Baylee L Reed, Dallin Tavoian, E Fiona Bailey, Janet L Funk, Dawn K Coletta","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Respiratory Muscles; Breathing Exercises; Resistance Training; Insulin Resistance; Male; Female; Muscle Strength; Adult; Middle Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Blood Glucose"

This study aims to examine the effect of thyroid hormone indices and their mediation role on the risk of GDM. Pregnant women in our study were recruited from the Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort, Zhejiang Province, China. Participants who had their first prenatal follow-up and measured thyroid biomarkers in the first trimester, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) records in the second trimester were eligible for inclusion in this study. The data were extracted from the Electronic Medical Record System database, at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital. Maternal information about sociodemographic and health-related characteristics was extracted from the dataset. A unique personal identification number was provided to link both datasets. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to investigate the correlations between thyroid hormone indices with GDM. The interaction effects of first-trimester thyroid hormone indices with pre-pregnancy BMI on GDM risk using a generalized linear regression model. Furthermore, the mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating effects of thyroid hormone indices on the relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and GDM. Overall, 5895 pregnant women were included in this study. The first-trimester FT4, thyroid feedback quantile-based index (TFQI), thyrotropin index (TSHI) and thyrotroph thyroxine resistance index (TT4RI) levels were negatively associated with fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PBG2H) in the second trimester (all P<0.05); FT3 and the FT3-to-FT4 ratio levels were positively associated with PBG1H and PBG2H in the second trimester (all P<0.05). Moreover, there were significant correlations between the highest quartile FT4, FT3, FT3-to-FT4 ratio, TSHI, and TFQI with GDM (all P < 0.05). The mediating effect of thyroid hormone parameters was 24.9% on the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and GDM. In conclusion, the low FT4, high FT3-to-FT4 ratio, and low TFQI in the first trimester significantly increase the risk of GDM and should be given more attention. Furthermore, increased pre-pregnancy BMI might partially increase the risk of GDM by influencing the body's thyroid function.","Xialidan Alifu, Zexin Chen, Yan Zhuang, Peihan Chi, Haoyue Cheng, Yiwen Qiu, Ye Huang, Libi Zhang, Diliyaer Ainiwan, Shuting Si, Zhicheng Peng, Haibo Zhou, Hui Liu, Yunxian Yu","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Diabetes, Gestational; Adult; Thyroid Hormones; China; Mediation Analysis; Body Mass Index; Obesity; Glucose Tolerance Test; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Thyroid Function Tests; Thyroxine; Thyrotropin"

This study aims to clarify the association between UHR and both all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in US adults. This study enrolled 48054 patients from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Mortality outcomes were determined by linking to National Death Index (NDI) records up to December 31,2019. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze explore the associations between UHR and mortality. Dose-response relationships were explored using restricted cubic splines, and stratified analyses were conducted based on gender, age, race, education, PIR, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, BMI, diabetes and hypertension. During the follow-up period, the overall mortality for all-cause and CVD was 10.9% and 2.7%, respectively. The adjusted HRs in the highest quintile were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.29) for all-cause mortality and 1.2 (95% CI: 1, 1.45) for CVD mortality. In diabetes, obese, and CVD subgroups, significantly elevated adjusted HRs were observed for both all-cause and CVD mortality. Specifically, diabetes patients had adjusted HRs of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.57) and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.90), obese individuals had HRs of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.58) and 1.55 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.28), and CVD patients had HRs of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.50) and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.79), respectively. A non-linear relationship between UHR and mortality was identified, with critical thresholds of 12.4 for all-cause mortality and 10.7 for CVD mortality in the general population. Significant interactions were observed between UHR and stratified variables, including gender, BMI, education, smoking, alcohol use, and hypertension for all-cause mortality, while significant interactions were observed based on gender, smoking, and alcohol intake for CVD mortality. Comparable trends were also observed in patient with diabetes, obese and CVD.

The study aimed to assess the association between sUA levels and two measures of cardiovascular risk, namely the Framingham 10-year Cardiovascular Risk Score (FRS) and the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP). This retrospective study used data from clinical records of new, previously unregistered patients presenting at a private cardiac hospital over one year from November 2022 to October 2023. In total, 428 patients presented newly to the hospital in that period. The records of 138 patients were included in the project after various exclusions were made including for incomplete anthropometric and laboratory data. Statistical tests of association were used to determine the significance of the relationship between sUA levels and the measures of cardiovascular risk. Two-tailed p <0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Hyperuricemia was more prevalent in individuals with central obesity, i.e., waist circumference ≥94cm in males or 80cm in females (93.4% vs 6.6%; p=0.03). Serum uric acid also positively correlated with FRS (correlation coefficient: 0.190; p<0.05) and serum triglyceride levels and AIP (correlation coefficient: 0.259 and 0.294, respectively; p<0.001 for both). After multivariate analyses, uric acid was significantly and independently associated with high FRS and AIP after adjusting for age, smoking and diabetes history, blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglycerides and waist circumference (p<0.001). The results emphasize the emergence of sUA as a pertinent cardiovascular risk factor in clinical settings.

Despite the growing prevalence of obesity and the central role of GPs, there is a dearth of research exploring their experiences and challenges in managing the disease. This study aimed to understand these challenges by exploring GPs' experiences and to identify factors influencing their obesity management practices to inform the development of targeted intervention strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 GPs. Data were analyzed using abductive thematic analysis underpinned by the theoretical domains framework (TDF). Findings were mapped to the behavior change wheel (BCW) and the behavior change taxonomy to identify potential future intervention strategies. Participants described multiple barriers to effective obesity management, including knowledge gaps, lack of training, patient factors, and systemic challenges. Key themes identified were the need for increased support, improved patient engagement, and system-level changes. This study offers valuable insights into the challenges GPs encounter when managing obesity in general practice. Application of the TDF and BCW frameworks identified complex interactions between knowledge, beliefs, and environmental factors influencing GP behavior.

The data of age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, prior urinary tract infection, prior stone passage, stone burden, stone density, number of stones, stone localization, surgery side, the presence of hydronephrosis and need for double J (DJ) stent due to difficult ureter for all patients were reviewed. Difficult ureter was defined as the insertion inability of a semi-rigid ureterorenoscope or UAS into the ureter at the surgery side. All patients were divided into two groups as difficult ureter group and non-difficult ureter group. A total of 454 patients who underwent RIRS for primary kidney stones were included. The incidence of difficult ureter was 7.5% (34/454). The patients in the difficult ureter group were younger. Female gender and prior urinary tract infection rates were higher in the difficult ureter group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the factors significantly associated with higher odds of having a difficult ureter in primary RIRS patients were younger age (OR 1.040; 95% CI 1.010-1.070; p = 0.008), female gender (OR 2.859; 95% Cl 1.383-5.908; p = 0.005) and prior urinary tract infection (OR 3.327; 95% CI 1.230-8.999; p = 0.018).

The study included 786 participants aged ≥65 years from the Kyotango Multipurpose Cohort Study who had available data on their gut microbiota. Frailty was quantitatively assessed by selecting 32 items from the previously reported frailty index, with those scoring ≥0.21 classified as frailty (n = 119) and those with scores <0.21 as non-frailty (n = 667), followed by group comparisons. The frailty group had significantly higher values and rates than the non-frailty group for the following items: age, obesity (in females only), diabetes, hypertension, history of cancer treatment, polypharmacy, disturbed sleep quality, low physical activity, serum insulin levels, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The frailty group had significantly lower levels of nutrients, including plant proteins, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), vitamins B and C, folic acid, and total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fiber. When analyzed by food groups of dietary fiber, the frailty group had significantly lower intakes of soy products and non-green-yellow vegetables, specifically. The Japanese Diet Index score (rJDI12) was significantly lower in the frailty group, with significant deficiencies in soy products and mushrooms included in the rJDI12. Cluster analysis of the Spearman correlation values between nutrient intake related to frailty and the gut microbiota abundance revealed a positive correlation between the cluster containing dietary fiber and the abundance of the phylum Bacillota, including the [Eubacterium]_eligens_group. In conclusion, our findings clarify the current state of frailty among older community residents and suggest the importance of a diverse range of plant-based foods, including soy products and non-green yellow vegetables, through correlation analysis with nutrients and food groups, and partially reveal the involvement of the gut microbiota.","Yuji Naito, Takeshi Yasuda, Hiroaki Kitae, Tomohisa Takagi, Katsura Mizushima, Teruhide Koyoma, Ryo Inoue, Norihiro Ouchi, Atsuo Adachi, Tadaaki Kamitani, Satoaki Matoba","Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition","2024Sep",NA
"39345245","Relationship between coronary artery disease with dyslipidaemia and trace mineral intake: a cross-sectional analysis of the Shika study.","Although the relationship between dyslipidaemia (DL) and coronary artery disease (CAD) or between trace minerals intake and CAD is well known separately, the exact nature of this relationship remains unknown. We hypothesize that the relationship between trace mineral intake and CAD may differ depending on whether or not the individual has DL. The present study analysed the relationships among trace mineral intake, DL, and CAD in middle-aged and older adults living in Shika town, Ishikawa prefecture, Japan. This study included 895 residents following the exclusion of those with genetic risk carriers for familial hypercholesterolemia. Trace mineral intake was evaluated using the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire. Interactions were observed between DL and CAD with zinc (p = 0.004), copper (p = 0.010), and manganese intake (p < 0.001) in a two-way analysis of covariance adjusted for covariates such as sex, age, body mass index, and current smokers and drinkers.

"39345243","Association between protein intake, diet quality, and obesity in Australian adults: a comparison of measurement units.","Previous investigations on protein associations with diet quality and obesity still have inconclusive findings, possibly due to how protein intake was expressed. This study aimed to compare how different ways of expressing total protein intake may influence its relationships with diet quality and obesity. Usual protein intake was estimated from the 2011-12 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 7637 adults, ≥19 years), expressed in grams (g/d), percent energy (%EI), and grams per actual kilogram body weight (g/kgBW/d). Diet quality was assessed using the 2013 Dietary Guidelines Index, and obesity measures included Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Sex-stratified multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed and adjusted for potential confounders. Total protein (g/d) was directly associated with diet quality (males, β = 0.15 (95% CI 0.12, 0.19); females, β = 0.25 (0.22, 0.29)), and this association was consistent across units. Protein intake (g/d) was directly associated with BMI (males, β = 0.07% (0.04%, 0.11%); females, β = 0.09% (0.04%, 0.15%)), and WC (males, β = 0.04 (0.01, 0.06); females, β = 0.05 (0.00, 0.09)). While in males, protein as %EI was associated with higher WC, no association was found in females. Adults with higher protein intake (g/d) had higher odds of overweight/obesity (males, OR = 1.01 (1.00, 1.01); females, OR = 1.01 (1.00, 1.01)), and central overweight/obesity (females, OR = 1.01 (1.00, 1.01)), but no significant association with females odds of overweight/obesity when protein was expressed in %EI. In conclusion, protein intake was positively associated with diet quality and obesity, yet these associations were stronger for women. The effect sizes also varied by measurement unit due to the different scales of those units.","Hesti Retno Budi Arini, Rebecca M Leech, Sze-Yen Tan, Sarah A McNaughton","Journal of nutritional science","2024","Humans; Male; Female; Obesity; Dietary Proteins; Adult; Australia; Body Mass Index; Middle Aged; Diet; Waist Circumference; Nutrition Surveys; Energy Intake; Young Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Nutrition Policy"
"39345029","Adherence to Mediterranean diet and prevalence of differentiated thyroid cancer: a single-center Unit of Thyroid Surgery experience in a Southern-Italy cohort.","The Mediterranean diet (MD) is recognized as a cultural heritage by UNESCO, thus, is a nutritional model widely spread in all Mediterranean countries. As already demonstrated by several studies, high adherence to MD is a protective factor against many chronic diseases. Conversely, poor adherence to the diet is correlated with an increased prevalence of these pathologies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the adherence to MD and the prevalence of benign and malignant thyroid disease. We analyzed the health status of 60 patients, referred to total thyroidectomy and histological examination, due to nodular thyroid disease. Eating habits were evaluated according to the PREDIMED questionnaire, and patients' results were evaluated according to histological findings of benign or malignant disease. PREDIMED Score was lower in patients with malignant thyroid disease (MTD) than those with benign thyroid disease (BTD) (5.27±0.87 vs. 7.00±1.23, respectively; P value <0.001). A significant correlation was found between poor adherence to MD and diagnosis of MTD (r=0.454; P<0.001). Excessive consumption of butter and sugary drinks, along with low consumption of pasta, white meat, and rice were found to be predictive factors of MTD. In our cohort, a PREDIMED Score ≤7 resulted significantly related to MTD diagnosis, while a good adherence to MD resulted associated with BTD. Moreover, high consumption of sweetened beverages seemed to predict MTD histologic diagnosis, while, conversely, low consumption resulted predictor of BTD. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the effective impact of MD on MTD incidence on larger cohorts.","Alessandro Monaco, Ludovica Verde, Marcello Filograna Pignatelli, Annamaria Docimo, Sonia Ferrandes, Luigi Barrea, Francesco Calisti, Giovanni Cozzolino, Giovanna Muscogiuri, Giovanni Docimo","Minerva endocrinology","2024Sep30",NA

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of socioeconomic factors and medical condition on visual impairment among older adults in Poland. An analysis was conducted utilizing near visual acuity assessments with Snellen charts and surveys among 5987 participants aged 60 years and over from the nationwide PolSenior2 study. A univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were created to identify risk factors for visual impairment. In a multivariable regression analysis, the odds of visual impairments were 1.72 times higher among individuals aged 75 years and over compared to those aged 60-74 years. Furthermore, individuals with primary education had 1.66 times higher odds of visual impairment compared to those with higher education. Individuals engaged in manual/farming work in the past, those who were unemployed in the past and those engaged in other job in the past had 1.25, 1.42 and 1.26 times higher odds of visual impairment, respectively, compared to white collar workers. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression analysis also revealed that obesity is associated with a 0.85 times lower odds of visual impairments. Our study revealed that socioeconomic factors significanlty impact visual health. Visual impairment was most prevalent among older age groups (age 75 and above), individuals with lower education levels or no education, the unemployed, and those who previously worked in manual labor or farming jobs or other. Additionally, obesity was inversely associated with visual impairment.","Adrian Lange, Natalia Lange, Kacper Jagiełło, Cezary Rydz, Bogdan Wojtyniak, Tomasz Zdrojewski","Polish archives of internal medicine","2024Sep30",NA

However, the association between the coexistence of low muscle mass and obesity and diabetic complications remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate these associations in patients with T2D. A retrospective study was conducted, including 2387 hospitalized patients with T2DM. Data on demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, diabetic complications and body composition was from electronic health records. The participants were categorized as control, low muscle mass, obesity and the coexistence of the low muscle mass and obesity groups according to the body compositions evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations between the pattern of body composition and complications of diabetes. After adjustment for potential confounders, compared with patients in the control group, the odds ratios [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of macrovascular complications of diabetes were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.27-1.39) for those in the low muscle mass group, 1.12 (95% CI, 0.59-2.11) in the obesity group, and 2.43 (95% CI, 1.16-5.07) in the coexistence of the low muscle mass and obesity group, respectively; the odds ratios (95% CIs) of microvascular complications of diabetes were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.52-1.43) for those in the low muscle mass group, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.53-1.26) in the obesity group, and 1.21 (95% CI, 0.69-2.15) in the coexistence of the low muscle mass and obesity group, respectively. According to our findings, the coexistence of low muscle mass and obesity, rather than low muscle mass or obesity alone, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of macrovascular complications in hospitalized patients with T2DM.

"39344847","Are patients with newly diagnosed frozen shoulder more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes? A cohort study in UK electronic health records.","To estimate the association between newly diagnosed frozen shoulder and a subsequent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in primary care. We conducted an age-, gender- and practice-matched cohort study in UK primary care electronic medical records containing 31 226 adults diagnosed with frozen shoulder, matched to 31 226 without frozen shoulder. Patients with pre-existing diabetes were excluded. Variables were identified using established Read codes. A hazard ratio (HR) for the association between incident frozen shoulder and a subsequent type 2 diabetes diagnosis was estimated using shared frailty Cox regression, adjusted for age and gender. To determine whether the association could be explained by increased testing for type 2 diabetes based on other risk factors, a secondary analysis involved re-running the Cox model adjusting for the mean number of consultations per year, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, thyroid dysfunction, ethnicity, deprivation, age, and gender. Participants with frozen shoulder were more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (1559 out of 31 226 patients [5%]) than participants without frozen shoulder (88 out of 31 226 patients [0.28%]). The HR for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in participants with frozen shoulder versus people without frozen shoulder was 19.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.6-24.0). The secondary analysis, adjusting for other factors, produced similar results: HR 20.0 (95% CI 16.0-25.0). People who have been newly diagnosed with frozen shoulder are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the following 15.8 years. The value of screening patients presenting with frozen shoulder for type 2 diabetes at presentation, alongside more established risk factors, should be considered in future research.","Brett P Dyer, Claire Burton, Trishna Rathod-Mistry, Miliça Blagojevic-Bucknall, Danielle A van der Windt","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","2024Sep30",NA

The CP algorithm was iteratively derived based on structured data from EHRs (UF Health System 2012-2020). We randomly selected 536 presumed cases among individuals aged <18 years who had (1) glycated haemoglobin levels ≥ 6.5%; or (2) fasting glucose levels ≥126 mg/dL; or (3) random plasma glucose levels ≥200 mg/dL; or (4) a diabetes-related diagnosis code from an inpatient or outpatient encounter; or (5) prescribed, administered, or dispensed diabetes-related medication. Four reviewers independently reviewed the patient charts to determine diabetes status and type. Presumed cases without type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis codes were categorized as non-diabetes/other types of diabetes. The rest were categorized as T1D if the most recent diagnosis was T1D, or otherwise categorized as T2D if the most recent diagnosis was T2D. Next, we applied a list of diagnoses and procedures that can determine diabetes type (e.g., steroid use suggests induced diabetes) to correct misclassifications from Step 1. Among the 536 reviewed cases, 159 and 64 had T1D and T2D, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the CP algorithm were 94%, 98% and 96%, respectively, for T1D and 95%, 95% and 73% for T2D.

"39344759","Machine learning model outperforms the ACS Risk Calculator in predicting non-home discharge following primary total knee arthroplasty.","Despite the increase in outpatient total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures, many patients are still discharged to non-home locations following index surgery. The ability to accurately predict non-home discharge (NHD) following TKAs has the potential to promote a reduction in associated adverse events and excess healthcare costs. This study aimed to evaluate whether a machine learning (ML) model could outperform the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Risk Calculator in predicting NHD following TKA, using the same set of clinical variables. We hypothesised that the ML model would outperform the ACS Risk Calculator. Data from 365,240 patients who underwent a primary TKA between 2013 and 2020 were extracted from the ACS-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict discharge disposition following primary TKA. The ANN and ACS calculator were assessed and compared using discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis. Age (>68 years), BMI (>35.5 kg/m2) and ASA Class (≥2) were found to be the most important variables in predicting NHD following TKA. When compared to the ACS calculator, the ANN model demonstrated a significantly superior ability to distinguish the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) among NHD patients and provided probability predictions well aligned with the true outcomes (AUCANN = 0.69, AUCACS = 0.50, p = 0.002, slopeANN = 0.85, slopeACS = 4.46, interceptANN = 0.04, and interceptACS = 0.06). Our findings support the hypothesis that machine learning models outperform the ACS Risk Calculator in predicting non-home discharge after TKA, even when constrained to the same clinical variables. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of integrating machine learning models into clinical practice for improving preoperative patient risk identification, optimisation, counselling and clinical decision-making.

"39344740","Association between dietary variety and anthropometric parameters in community-dwelling older adults: results of a population-based PolSenior study.","Dietary variety (DV) is recognized as a key indicator of diet quality. It is based on the premise that eating a wide variety of foods ensures an adequate intake of essential nutrients which, in turn, leads to better diet quality. The aim of the study is to examine the relationships between DV, diet quality and selected anthropometric parameters in older adults. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 1,071 participants (average age: 72.8 years) from a population cohort of older adults living in Poland. DV was measured using the Dietary Variety Score (DVS) and Dietary Diversity Score (DDS), based on 3-day food records. The associations between DV and anthropometric parameters were examined using cluster analysis. Three clusters were identified: high DV (Cluster 1 - 33%), moderate DV (Cluster 2 - 41%) and low DV (Cluster 3 - 26%). Moderate DV showed a positive relationship with lower BMI values, particularly in women (p<0.05). High and moderate DV was inversely associated with lower values of abdominal adiposity measures, compared to the low DV in the women group only (p<0.05). The diet quality score was greater in the high DV, compared to the low DV (12.6 vs. 7.5; p<0.001). Low DV constituted a high-risk group and had the lowest intake of energy (100% participants) and almost all nutrients, especially protein (62%) and micronutrients (>30-96%; depending on the nutrient). A higher degree of DV was associated with better anthropometric parameters in older adults. These relationships were more pronounced in women than in men. High DV improves the intake levels of energy, protein and micronutrients, and also enhances overall dietary quality. Older adults require personalized guidance and dietary support, including a high dietary variety of nutrient-dense foods/food groups.","Justyna Bylinowska, Elżbieta Wierzbicka, Agata Białecka-Dębek, Małgorzata Mossakowska, Aleksandra Szybalska, Barbara Pietruszka","Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM","2024Sep25","Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Poland; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Independent Living; Anthropometry; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index"

The aim of the research was to find possible dependencies between different risk factors, and the actual fractures that were recorded in the database. For each risk factor and for each category (e.g., patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes), the percentage was computed of patients who had incidents osteoporotic fractures, and the percentage of those without fractures. Student's t-test and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to find statistically significant risk factors. Statistically significant risk factors were found: age, chronic kidney disease, T-scores of the femoral neck and T-score of the lumbar spine, serum phosphate levels, FRAX-BMD, FRAX-BMI, and the type of diet. Some observations concerning the influence of individual risk factors on the occurrence of fractures are consistent with those presented in the literature. However, it was also noticed that the patients with hyperthyroidism, rheumatic diseases, diabetes, cancer or gastrointestinal diseases, had a smaller percentage of fractures than the patients who did not have these diseases. This may be explained by the small number of those having these diseases, or by the fact that they had already received appropriate treatment.","Dorota Lis-Studniarska, Marcin Studniarski, Aleksandra Zakrzewska, Robert Irzmański","Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM","2024Sep25","Humans; Risk Factors; Poland; Female; Aged; Osteoporosis; Middle Aged; Male; Osteoporotic Fractures; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density"

However, distinct molecular defects specific to testosterone deficiency have been identified in pathways relating to glucose and lipid metabolism in target metabolic depots such as adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

This study investigated whether SNPs previously identified by GWAS as risk factors for severe COVID-19 also correlate with common comorbidities-obesity and T2DM-in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. DNA samples from 199 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were genotyped using probe-based PCR for 10 GWAS SNPs previously implicated in severe COVID-19 outcomes (rs143334143 CCHCR1, rs111837807 CCHCR1, rs17078346 SLC6A20-LZTFL1, rs17713054 SLC6A20-LZTFL1, rs7949972 ELF5, rs61882275 ELF5, rs12585036 ATP11A, rs67579710 THBS3, THBS3-AS1, rs12610495 DPP9, rs9636867 IFNAR2). The analysis revealed significant associations between certain SNPs and the increased risk of obesity and T2DM in severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, rs17713054 SLC6A20-LZTFL1 (risk allele A; odds ratio (OR) = 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24-4.4, p = 0.007) and rs7949972 ELF5 SNP (risk allele T; OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.11-2.91, p = 0.015) were associated with increased risk of obesity. SNP rs9636867 IFNAR2 was associated with a higher risk of T2DM (risk allele G, OR = 8.28, 95% CI = 1.69-40.64, p = 0.027).

Additionally, the published findings point to the roles of obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and imbalance in gut microbiota in Aβ accumulation caused by obesity. Therefore, in-depth experimental and clinical studies on these mechanisms in the future may help shed light on appropriate prevention and treatment strategies for AD, such as dietary changes and regular exercise to reverse or prevent obesity and related metabolic disorders.","Wei Wen, Shu-Ming Huang, Bo Zhang","Journal of integrative neuroscience","2024Sep05","Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Obesity; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Gastrointestinal Microbiome"

This is the first study to investigate the trends and population-attributable fraction (PAF) of obesity, and the interaction effects of education and wealth on obesity among reproductive-age women aged 15-49 years in ten Asian countries. This cross-sectional study examined the most recent (2000 to 2022) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from ten Central and Southeast Asian countries. Multilevel multinomial logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs). PAFs adjusted for communality were calculated using adjusted ORs and prevalence estimates for each risk factor. This study included a weighted sample of 743,494 reproductive-age women. All the countries showed an increasing trend for obesity and a decreasing trend for underweight, except for the Maldives. The highest PAFs of obesity were associated with women who were married (PAF = 22.2%; 95% CI 22.1, 22.4), aged 35-49 years (PAF = 16.4%; 95% CI 15.5, 17.1), resided in wealthy households (PAF = 14.5%; 95% CI 14.4, 14.5), watched television regularly (PAF = 12.5%; 95% CI 12.1, 12.8), and lived in urban areas (PAF = 7.8%; 95% CI 7.7, 8.0). The combined PAF showed that these five risk factors were associated with 73.3% (95% CI 71.8, 74.9) of obesity among reproductive-age women. Interaction analysis between women's education and household wealth revealed that having a secondary or higher level of education and residing in a wealthier household was associated with a lower risk of obesity (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). The findings of this study suggest that, in order to address the rising rate of obesity among women in Asian countries, education and lifestyle modifications in urban areas should be a priority. Pakistan and the Maldives need to be a priority given the rapidly increasing trends in obesity and underweight subpopulations in their respective countries.","Subash Thapa, Kedir Y Ahmed, Habtamu Mellie Bizuayehu, M Mamun Huda, Binaya Chalise, Meless G Bore, Sewunet Admasu Belachew, Tahir A Hassen, Erkihun Amsalu, Desalegn Markos Shifti, Abdulbasit Seid, Yonatan M Mesfin, Teketo Kassaw Tegegne, Abel F Dadi, Daniel Bogale Odo, Getiye Dejenu Kibret, Daniel Bekele Ketema, Zemenu Yohannes Kassa, Anayochukwu E Anyasodor, Shakeel Mahmood, Feleke Hailemichael Astawesegn, Allen G Ross","Scientific reports","2024Sep29","Humans; Female; Adult; Obesity; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Young Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Risk Factors; Asia; Prevalence; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Surveys; Epidemics"
"39343929","Diesel exhaust particle inhalation in conjunction with high-fat diet consumption alters the expression of pulmonary SARS-COV-2 infection pathways, which is mitigated by probiotic treatment in C57BL/6 male mice.","Both exposure to air pollutants and obesity are associated with increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection; however, the mechanistic pathways involved are not well-characterized. After being primed by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or furin protease, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor to enter respiratory epithelial cells. The androgen receptor (AR) is known to regulate both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression, and neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a proposed coreceptor for SARS-CoV-2; thus, altered expression of these factors may promote susceptibility to infection. As such, this study investigated the hypothesis that inhalational exposure to traffic-generated particulate matter (diesel exhaust particulate; DEP) increases the expression of those pathways that mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection and susceptibility, which is exacerbated by the consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet. Four- to six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed either regular chow or a HF diet (HF, 45% kcal from fat) were randomly assigned to be exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 35 µg DEP suspended in 35 µl 0.9% sterile saline or sterile saline only (control) twice a week for 30 days. Furthermore, as previous studies have shown that probiotic treatment can protect against exposure-related inflammatory outcomes in the lungs, a subset of study animals fed a HF diet were concurrently treated with 0.3 g/day Winclove Ecologic® Barrier probiotics in their drinking water throughout the study. Our results revealed that the expression of ACE2 protein increased with DEP exposure and that TMPRSS2, AR, NRP1, and furin protein expression increased with DEP exposure in conjunction with a HF diet. These DEP ± HF diet-mediated increases in expression were mitigated with probiotic treatment. These findings suggest that inhalational exposure to air pollutants in conjunction with the consumption of a HF diet contributes to a more susceptible lung environment to SARS-CoV-2 infection and that probiotic treatment could be beneficial as a preventative measure.","Kayla Nguyen-Alley, Sarah Daniel, Danielle T Phillippi, Tyler D Armstrong, Bailee Johnson, Winston Ihemeremadu, Amie K Lund","Particle and fibre toxicology","2024Sep29","Animals; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Diet, High-Fat; Vehicle Emissions; COVID-19; Mice; SARS-CoV-2; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Probiotics; Inhalation Exposure; Lung; Neuropilin-1; Serine Endopeptidases; Particulate Matter"
"39343891","Study protocol for Early Tracking of Childhood Health determinants (ETCHED): A longitudinal observational life course study.","The prevalence of childhood obesity and diabetes continues to rise in the United States (US), especially among minority populations. The objective of the Early Tracking of Childhood Health Determinants (ETCHED) study is to investigate the role of adverse fetal and early-life risk exposures that contribute to the development of childhood obesity and metabolic risk. ETCHED is a longitudinal observational study of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) and Hispanic pregnant woman and their offspring. Pregnant mothers ≥ 18 years old are enrolled at a large public hospital system in the southwestern US. Enrolled mothers are followed through pregnancy, delivery, and the maternal/offspring dyad will be followed until the child's 18th birthday. At each maternal visit, questionnaires assessing medical history, diet, physical activity, sleep, perceived stress, and socioeconomic and sociocultural information are obtained. Standard laboratory tests during maternal visits include glycemic measures, lipids, and renal function. Additional bio samples obtained include venous blood samples and cord blood for obesity/metabolic biomarkers and genetic/epigenetic testing, urinalysis, placental tissue for examining functional pathways, breast milk for metabolomics, and stool for metabolites and microbiome analysis. The offspring will have 6 infant/toddler visits at 6-12 weeks, 4 months, 6 months, 18 months, 2 and 3 years respectively. Thereafter, they will undergo comprehensive research visits (major visits) at 4-5 years, 6-9 years, 10-13 years, and 14-17 years. The major visits in children include detailed medical history, anthropometry, developmental assessment, socioeconomic and environmental assessments (food insecurity, family structure, and childcare), feeding and activity, biochemical tests, genetics/epigenetic testing, and ultrasound elastography. Electronic health records will be reviewed for additional clinical information. The primary analysis will constitute estimation of correlation coefficients between continuous variables. The planned study duration in this ongoing study is 23-years. This is a life course study that that will examine biological and environmental risk factors for obesity and cardiometabolic risk from the intrauterine period to early childhood and adolescence in a population with high-risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the United States. The ETCHED study would also provide a unique opportunity to combine multi-omics and clinical data to create novel integrative models to predict the cardiometabolic risk associated with childhood obesity and possibly identify etiopathogenetic mechanisms and future targets of intervention.

"39343762","Incidence, characteristics and risk factors of endotracheal tube-related pressure injuries in intensive care units.","Medical devices commonly used for the treatment and care of critically ill patients can cause pressure injuries in intensive care units (ICUs). The endotracheal tube (ETT) is one of the most common medical devices to cause pressure injuries. This study investigated the incidence of, characteristics of and risk factors for ETT-related pressure injuries for ICU patients. This study adopted a prospective descriptive research design. The sample consisted of 146 endotracheally intubated patients. Data were collected using a patient information form, an Endotracheal Tube-Related Pressure Injuries Assessment Form, the Braden Risk Assessment Tool and the Nutritional Assessment Test. The study revealed that 80.14% of the patients developed ETT-related pressure injuries. Over half of the ETT-related pressure injuries appeared on Day 3 or 4 (56.41%). High body mass index was found to be associated with the development of ETT-related pressure injuries (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.26, p = .003). None of the other variables were statistically significant in the development of pressure injuries. The incidence of ETT-related pressure injuries was quite high in the internal, surgical and anaesthesia ICUs. High body mass index was associated with the development of ETT-related pressure injuries. Intensive care nurses should implement interventions to prevent ETT-related pressure injuries in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation support. ETT-related pressure injuries are common in ICU patients. High body mass index was associated with the development of ETT-related pressure injuries in critically ill patients. The skin and mucosa should be assessed for the development of ETT-related pressure injuries during the daily assessment of the patients receiving mechanical ventilation support. The ETT should be repositioned regularly, and the most suitable ETT fixation method should be used.","Cansu Cambaz, Zeliha Ozdemir Koken, Mehmet Murat Sayin","Nursing in critical care","2024Sep29",NA
"39343724","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: The importance of physical activity and nutrition education-A randomized controlled study.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver, causing liver cell damage, increased inflammation, and weight gain. Despite its high prevalence, diagnosis and follow-up of the disease is difficult. Irisin, a slimming myokine produced in response to physical activity (PA), exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects. This study aimed to investigate changes in irisin levels, inflammation markers (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD2) levels in NAFLD, as well as anthropometric and routine biochemical parameters, by providing PA recommendations and nutrition education (NE) to individuals diagnosed with NAFLD over a period of 12 weeks. The study included 62 patients diagnosed with NAFLD who did not use alcohol. They were divided into groups: PA, NE, both (NE + PA), and untreated (control) patients. Patients receiving NE were provided with 1-h NE sessions every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, and their personal information, nutritional status, 24-h retrospective food consumption record, and anthropometric measurements were recorded at the beginning (day 0) and end (week 12) of the study. The PA group was recommended aerobic walking for 30 min, 5 days a week. At the beginning (day 0) and end (week 12) of the study, patients' anthropometric and routine biochemical tests were conducted, and irisin, MD2, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels were measured using the ELISA method. All groups were similar in demographic characteristics and dietary habits. After 12 weeks, there were no significant differences in biochemical parameters among the groups. Glucose levels increased in the untreated group but decreased in the PA and PA + NE groups compared to baseline, with a significant decrease in the PA group. Insulin levels significantly decreased in the NE group. The PA + NE group showed decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels and significant decrease in ALT levels. AST decreased significantly in the PA group while high-density lipoprotein increased significantly. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in irisin, MD2, IL-6, and TNF-α levels. After 12 weeks, irisin levels significantly increased in nutrition and PA groups except the untreated group. There were no statistically significant differences in IL-6 and MD2 levels compared with baseline after 12 weeks. PA recommendations alone were not effective in observing significant changes in anthropometric measurements in individuals with NAFLD. It was detected that only nutritional recommendations provided a significant decrease in body fat ratio but were insufficient for the change in other anthropometric measurements. In the group where NE and PA were recommended together, a significant decrease in anthropometric measurements was found. The NE group significantly reduced their energy and carbohydrates (%EI) intake after 12 weeks of intervention compared with the baseline. NE and PA recommendations led to improvements in liver-related biochemical parameters and significant reductions in anthropometric measurements among individuals with NAFLD. Moreover, patients receiving NE experienced a decrease in energy and carbohydrates intake as a percentage of total energy intake (%EI). Increased irisin levels in NE, PA, and NE + PA groups may have contributed to the decrease in body fat percentage.","Diler Us Altay, Yasemin Kaya, Duygu Mataraci Değirmenci, Emine Kocyiğit, Abdullah Üner, Tevfik Noyan","Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology","2024Sep29",NA
"39343716","Influence of Obesity on the Efficacy and Toxicity of Patients Undergoing Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Lymphoma.","Hematopoietic cell transplantation requires higher doses of chemotherapy, and practices of adjusting the weight because of concerns of organ toxicity are common. This retrospective analysis of 239 adult recipients of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation for lymphoma assessed the effect of obesity on transplantation outcomes. Prior data evaluating the impact of obesity in autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) for lymphomas have provided differing results when assessing overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Impact on survival outcomes have been described, but direct comparison of discrete toxicities is lacking. We retrospectively compared outcomes with patients divided between 3 groups: nonobese patients (n = 129), obese patients dosed on adjusted body weight (AdjBW) (n = 32), and obese patients dosed on total body weight (TBW) (n = 78). In multivariate analysis of OS with the nonobese group as the comparator, outcomes trended worse in obese patients dosed on AdjBW (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.52-2.85) but were improved in obese patients dosed on TBW (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.85, P = .012). PFS of obese patients dosed on AdjBW vs. the nonobese group was comparable (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.63-2.24), but improved in obese patients dosed on TBW (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.89, P = .021). Notably, no differences were noted between groups in gastrointestinal, infectious, renal, or hepatic toxicities. In summary, our data suggest that recipients of AHCT for lymphoma should be dosed on TBW to maximize curative outcomes with no apparent increase in toxicities.","Andrew Lin, Nicole Pearl, Jessica Flynn, Sean Devlin, Parastoo Dahi, Miguel-Angel Perales, Michael Scordo, Gunjan L Shah","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia","2024Sep12",NA
"39343707","Muscle Fat and Volume Differences in People With Hip-Related Pain Compared With Controls: A Machine Learning Approach.","Hip-related pain (HRP) affects young to middle-aged active adults and impacts physical activity, finances and quality of life. HRP includes conditions like femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears. Lateral hip muscle dysfunction and atrophy in HRP are more pronounced in advanced hip pathology, with limited evidence in younger populations. While MRI use for assessing hip muscle morphology is increasing, with automated deep-learning techniques showing promise, studies assessing their accuracy are limited. Therefore, we aimed to compare hip intramuscular fat infiltrate (MFI) and muscle volume, in individuals with and without HRP as well as assess the reliability and accuracy of automated machine-learning segmentations compared with human-generated segmentation. This cross-sectional study included sub-elite/amateur football players (Australian football and soccer) with a greater than 6-month history of HRP [n = 180, average age 28.32, (standard deviation 5.88) years, 19% female] and a control group of sub-elite/amateur football players without pain [n = 48, 28.89 (6.22) years, 29% female]. Muscle volume and MFI of gluteus maximus, medius, minimis and tensor fascia latae were assessed using MRI. Associations between muscle volume and group were explored using linear regression models, controlling for body mass index, age, sport and sex. A convolutional neural network (CNN) machine-learning approach was compared with human-performed muscle segmentations in a subset of participants (n = 52) using intraclass correlation coefficients and Sorensen-Dice index. When considering adjusted estimates of muscle volume, there were significant differences observed between groups for gluteus medius (adjusted mean difference 23 858 mm3 [95% confidence interval 7563, 40 137]; p = 0.004) and tensor fascia latae (6660 mm3 [2440, 13 075]; p = 0.042). No differences were observed between groups for gluteus maximus (18 265 mm3 [-21 209, 50 782]; p = 0.419) or minimus (3893 mm3 [-2209, 9996]; p = 0.21). The CNN was trained for 30 000 iterations and assessed its accuracy and reliability on an independent testing dataset, achieving high segmentation accuracy (mean Sorenson-Dice index >0.900) and excellent muscle volume and MFI reliability (ICC2,1 > 0.900). The CNN outperformed manual raters, who had slightly lower interrater accuracy (Sorensen-Dice index >0.800) and reliability (ICC2,1 > 0.800). The increased muscle volumes in the symptomatic group compared with controls could be associated with increased myofibrillar size, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy or both. These changes may facilitate greater muscular efficiency for a given load, enabling the athlete to maintain their normal level of function. In addition, the CNNs for muscle segmentation was more efficient and demonstrated excellent reliability in comparison to manual segmentations.","Chris Stewart, Evert O Wesselink, Zuzana Perraton, Kenneth A Weber, Matthew G King, Joanne L Kemp, Benjamin F Mentiplay, Kay M Crossley, James M Elliott, Joshua J Heerey, Mark J Scholes, Peter R Lawrenson, Chris Calabrese, Adam I Semciw","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle","2024Sep29",NA

However, limited studies have evaluated its incidence and progression to advanced fibrosis in the elderly population. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the incidence of MASLD and advanced fibrosis in this age group. We included 878 686 individuals aged ≥60 years from the Korea National Health Insurance Service-Senior cohort. After excluding participants with preexisting MASLD, 329 388 individuals were finally analyzed. Participants were categorized into four groups based on the presence of overweight/obesity and additional risk factors (aRF) included in the cardiometabolic diagnostic criteria of MASLD. The overall incidence of MASLD was 1.94 per 100 person-years, and the incidence of advanced fibrosis in MASLD patients was 1.78 per 100 person-years. MASLD development was significantly higher in overweight/obese patients (2.65 per 100 person-years) compared to lean patients (1.09 per 100 person-years), and this trend persisted after stratification by the presence of aRF. Similarly, the incidence of advanced fibrosis among MASLD patients was higher in overweight/obese individuals (2.06 per 100 person-years) compared to lean counterparts (0.87 per 100 person-years), irrespective of aRF. The lower incidence of MASLD in the elderly population compared to the general population underscores the importance of identifying age-specific risk factors. Overweight/obesity emerged as a robust predictor of MASLD development and advanced fibrosis. Additionally, the presence of additional cardiometabolic risk factors further increased the risk of incident MASLD and advanced fibrosis among the elderly.","Kunhee Kim, Yaeji Lee, Jae Seung Lee, Mi Na Kim, Beom Kyung Kim, Seung Up Kim, Jun Yong Park, Do Young Kim, Sang Hoon Ahn, Inkyung Jung, Hye Won Lee","Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology","2024Sep29",NA

All patients who had longitudinal groin incisions at a single institution from 2021-2022 were included. The medical records were reviewed and all groin-related WC were identified. WC were stratified into major and minor WC where major WC were those requiring re-operation or hospital re-admission. Patients were stratified into obese (BMI>30kg/m2) and non-obese cohorts. A total of 238 groin incisions were included. There were 46 (19.3%) obese and 192(80.7%) non-obese patients. 156 (65.5%) were closed with nylon, 49 (20.6%) were closed in a subcuticular fashion, and 32 (13.4%) were closed with staples. There were 45 (18.9%) WC; 15 (33.3%) major and 30 (66.7 %) minor. Obesity was associated with a higher WC rate (39.1% vs 14.1%, p<0.001), which was driven by minor WC (32.6% vs 7.8%, p<0.001) rather than major WC (6.5% vs 5.7%, p=0.873). On multivariable analysis, obesity remained a predictor for overall (OR 4.953, p<0.001) and minor WC (OR 7.389, p<0.001). Additionally, female sex was associated with a higher rate of WC on unadjusted (27.6% vs 12.8%, p=0.016) and adjusted analysis (OR 2.411, p=0.014). Among obese patients, subcuticular closure was associated with higher rates of minor complications (OR 8.454, p=0.044). Obese patients with major complications less frequently had close follow-up including rehab disposition, discharge with visiting nurse, or frequent office wound checks than those with minor complications (33.33% vs 86.67%, p=0.043). Groin WC are more common in obese and female patients. Among obese patients, this difference is driven primarily by minor WC. Avoiding a subcuticular skin closure may reduce the risk of minor WC in obese patients. In addition, close postoperative follow up using rehab, visiting nurse services, and frequent office wound checks may prevent minor complications from escalating to major complications.","Randall A Bloch, Jacob L Neir, Elisa Caron, Scott G Prushik, Katie E Shean, Mark F Conrad","Annals of vascular surgery","2024Sep27",NA
"39343353","Systemic and Joint Adipose Tissue Lipids and their Role in Osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major disease whose prevalence increases with aging, sedentary lifestyles, and obesity. The association between obesity and OA has been well documented, but the precise mechanisms underlying this heightened risk remain unclear. While obesity imposes greater forces on joints, systemic fat-derived factors such as lipids or adipokine may potentially act on the pathophysiology of OA, but the exact role of these factors in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints remains elusive. Intra-articular adipose tissues (IAAT) have gained significant attention for actively participating in OA pathogenesis by interacting with various joint tissues. Lipid content has been proposed as a diagnostic target for early OA detection and a potential source of biomarkers. Moreover, targeting a specific IAAT called infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) and its lipids hold promise for attenuating OA-associated inflammation. Conversely, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), which was long thought to be an inert filling tissue, is now increasingly considered a dynamic tissue whose volume and lipid content regulate bone remodeling in pathological conditions. Given OA's ability to alter adipose tissues, particularly those within the joint (IFP and BMAT), and the influence of adipose tissues on OA pathogenesis, this review examines the lipids produced by OA-associated adipose tissues, shedding light on their potential role in OA pathophysiology and highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets.","Natalia Zapata-Linares, Lea Loisay, Diego de Haro, Francis Berenbaum, Thomas Hügle, Jeroen Geurts, Xavier Houard","Biochimie","2024Sep27",NA

This retrospective study aims to determine the impact of CFTR modulators on maternal outcomes. Does pregnancy differentially impact outcomes in females with CF with and without CFTR modulators? We collected data on pregnancies from 2010-2021 from 11 US adult CF centers. We conducted multivariable longitudinal regression analysis to assess whether changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1), body mass index (BMI), pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence differed from before, during, and after pregnancy by CFTR modulator use, while adjusting for confounders. We also describe infant outcomes based on maternal modulator use. Among 307 pregnancies, mean age at conception was 28.5 years (range: 17-42), pre-pregnancy ppFEV1 was 74.2 and BMI was 22.3 kg/m2. One hundred and fourteen pregnancies (37.1%) had CFTR modulator exposure during pregnancy (77 with highly effective modulator therapy [HEMT] and 37 with other modulators). The adjusted mean change in ppFEV1 from pre- to during pregnancy was -2.36 (95%CI: -3.56, -1.16) in the unexposed group and +2.60(95%CI: 0.23, 4.97) in the HEMT group, with no significant change from during to one-year post-pregnancy. There was an overall decline in ppFEV1 from pre- to post-pregnancy in the no modulator group (-2.56; 95%CI:-3.62, -1.49) that was not observed in the HEMT group (1.10; 95%CI: -1.13, 3.34). PEx decreased from pre- to post-pregnancy in the HEMT group and BMI increased from pre- to during pregnancy in all groups but without a significant change post-pregnancy. Missing infant outcome data precluded firm conclusions. We observed superior pregnancy and post-pregnancy pulmonary outcomes in individuals who used HEMT, including a preservation of ppFEV1, compared with those unexposed to HEMT.","Raksha Jain, Giselle Peng, MinJae Lee, Ashley Keller, Sophia Cosmich, Sarthak Reddy, Natalie E West, Traci M Kazmerski, Jennifer L Goralski, Patrick A Flume, Andrea H Roe, Denis Hadjiliadis, Ahmet Uluer, Sheila Mody, Sigrid Ladores, Jennifer L Taylor-Cousar","Chest","2024Sep27",NA
"39343180","Curcumol effectively improves obesity through GDF15 induction via activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response.","The escalating prevalence of obesity presents a formidable global health challenge, underscoring the imperative for efficacious pharmacotherapeutic interventions. However, current anti-obesity medications often exhibit limited efficacy and adverse effects, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has emerged as a promising target for obesity management, given its crucial role in appetite control and metabolic regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of curcumol, a sesquiterpene compound derived from plants of the Zingiberaceae family, in obesity treatment. Our findings demonstrate that curcumol effectively induces the expression of GDF15 through the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. To confirm the role of GDF15 as a critical target for curcumol's function, we compared the effects of curcumol in wild-type mice and Gdf15-knockout mice. Using a high-fat diet-induced obese murine model, we observed that curcumol led to reduced appetite and altered dietary preferences mediated by GDF15. Furthermore, chronic curcumol intervention resulted in promising anti-obesity effects. Additionally, curcumol administration improved glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism in the obese mice. These findings highlight the potential of curcumol as a GDF15 inducer and suggest innovative strategies for managing obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the efficacy of curcumol in obesity treatment by inducing GDF15 expression. The identified effects of curcumol on appetite regulation, dietary preferences, glucose tolerance, and lipid metabolism emphasize its potential as a therapeutic agent for combating obesity and related metabolic disorders.","Lin Wang, Jia-Jia Huang, Wei-Jia Zhu, Zhao-Kun Zhai, Chan Lin, Xiao Guan, Hai-Ping Liu, Tong Dou, Yi-Zhun Zhu, Xu Chen","Biochemical pharmacology","2024Sep27",NA

"39343101","Results of the RE-DINO multicenter randomized trial on the repeated use of vaginal dinoprostone (Propess®) for labor induction in patients at term.","Labor is induced in over 25% of women in France. Prostaglandins, especially intravaginal dinoprostone (Propess®), are widely used to initiate cervical ripening. If labor does not start within 24 hours, there is uncertainty about whether to administer a second dinoprostone pessary or to use oxytocin to induce labor in order to achieve a vaginal delivery. Our principal objective was to determine whether placement of a second Propess®, followed by oxytocin (Syntocinon®) if necessary, in pregnant women for whom the first Propess® failed to induce cervical ripening increases the vaginal delivery rate compared to direct oxytocin injection. The vaginal delivery rate was therefore the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were the cervical ripening failure rate and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. RE-DINO is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized superiority trial with two parallel arms running in 7 French hospitals. Patients at > 37 weeks of gestation who had unfavorable cervical conditions (Bishop score < 6) 24 hours after placement of the first Propess® (vaginal patch featuring progressive continuous diffusion of 10 mg dinoprostone), with fetuses in cephalic presentation, were included. 160 pregnant women were randomized, 80 patients in each group, from December 2016 through April 2022. Baseline characteristics such as age, BMI, maternal age at induction and Bishop score at induction were similar between both groups. Vaginal delivery occurred in 76.3% of cases in the 2nd Propessࣨ group and 73.8% of cases in the Syntocinon® group (RR = 1.03 [0.86; 1.24], p=0.715). Although the cesarean section rate was similar in each group, there were significantly more cesarean sections for arrest of dilatation (52.6% vs 19%; p=0.0262) in the Propess® group and a larger, borderline-significant difference in patients having operative vaginal delivery (24.6% vs 11.9%; p=0.07) for abnormal fetal heart rate (80% vs 29%; p=0.05). There was significantly more failure of cervical ripening in the Propessࣨ group (57.1% vs 19%; RR=2.59 ; 95% CI [1.64; 4.11]; p < 0.0001) and the interval between study treatment and delivery was also significantly longer (28.1h vs 9,7h; p<0.0001). There was a higher incidence of post-partum hemorrhage in the Propessࣨ group, although this was not significant (11.3% vs 5% ; p=0,15), but also more newborns with acidosis (39.3% vs 27.9% ; p=0.18) or severe acidosis (8,6% vs 3.4% ; p=0.27), more meconium fluid (11.3% vs 6.3% ; p =0.26) and transferred to intensive care (5% vs 2.5% ; p=0.68).

"39343034","Are the EAT-Lancet dietary recommendations associated with cardiometabolic health? - insights from the Generation XXI cohort from childhood into early adolescence.","The prospective effect of healthy and planetary diets on cardiometabolic health at young ages remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the prospective associations between adherence to the EAT-Lancet dietary recommendations at age 7 and the prevalence of obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) at 7, 10, and 13 years old (y). Participants are children from the Generation XXI birth cohort, who completed 3-day food diaries at age 7, with complete data in variables of interest (n 3564). Adherence to the EAT-Lancet dietary recommendations was evaluated using the World Index for Sustainability and Health (WISH); a higher score indicating a healthier and environmentally sustainable diet. At 7, 10 and 13y, anthropometrics (weight, height and waist circumference-WC), blood pressure (BP) and serum-fasting triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and glucose were measured. Obesity and MetS prevalence were determined by the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation criteria, respectively. Adjusted custom binomial log-linear models were used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) (covariates: mother's age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational diabetes, child's sex, age, tanner stage, sports practice and total grams of the remaining food). From 7 to 13y, obesity decreased from 14.1% to 9.3% and MetS increased from 1.0% to 5.1%. Higher WISH scores at 7y were associated with a lower prevalence of obesity, measured by both BMI (≥97th percentile: PR=0.912, 95%CI: 0.839,0.991; PR=0.882, 95%CI: 0.79,0.938, respectively at 10 and 13y) and WC (≥90th percentile: PR=0.899, 95%CI: 0.830,0.974; PR=0.858, 95%CI:0.782,0.942, respectively at 10 and 13y). For each 10-point increase in the WISH, a reduction of 16% in MetS prevalence at 13y was observed (PR=0.837, 95%CI: 0.732,0.957). No significant effects were found at younger ages.

First, a preliminary systematic search was conducted to identify articles published before May 23, 2024 that reported on viraemia during infection with respiratory viruses. The articles were then analysed for relevant terms to identify the prevalence of viraemia, its association with the disease severity and long-term consequences, and host responses. A total of 202 articles were included in the final study. The pooled prevalence of viraemia was 34% for SARS-CoV-2 and between 6% and 65% for other viruses. Association of viraemia with disease severity was extensively reported for SARS-CoV-2 and also for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (albeit with low evidence). SARS-CoV-2 viraemia was linked to memory problems and worsened quality of life. Viraemia was associated with signatures denoting dysregulated host responses. In conclusion, the high prevalence of viraemia and its association with disease severity suggests that viraemia could be a relevant pathophysiological event with important translational implications in respiratory viral infections.","Karl Hagman, Tamara Postigo, David Diez-Castro, Johan Ursing, Jesús F Bermejo-Martin, Amanda de la Fuente, Ana P Tedim","The Lancet.

"39342804","Association of mixed exposure to microplastics with sperm dysfunction: a multi-site study in China.","Microplastics are environmental pollutants detected in various human organs and tissues. These particles originate from multiple sources including the degradation of larger plastic items and the intentional inclusion in consumer goods. Potential risks for human health resulting from microplastics exposure have also been reported. However, the distribution in the male reproductive system and its effect remains largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the presence of multiple microplastics in human semen and urine and their association with sperm quality in a multi-site study across China. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 113 male participants from three regions in China. Semen and urine samples were collected and analysed using Raman microscopy to detect eight types of microplastics: polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Semen quality parameters, including total sperm count, concentration, motility, and morphology, were assessed. Statistical analyses, including single and multi-variable models, were used to evaluate the relationship between microplastic exposure and semen quality, with a focus on PTFE, after adjusting confounding factors of age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol drinking, and sites. Microplastics were detected in all semen and urine samples, with participants typically exposed to 3-5 different types. The detection rates of PS, PP and PE were the highest. Notably, PTFE exposure was significantly associated with decreased semen quality. Participants exposed to PTFE showed reductions in total sperm count [188.90 ± 163.71 vs. 207.67 ± 132.36 million, p = 0.091], sperm concentration [52.13 ± 47.47 vs. 58.32 ± 37.26 million/mL, p = 0.041], and progressive motility [40.29% ± 19.06 vs. 34.11% ± 17.02, p = 0.083]. The multi-linear regression analysis indicated that each additional type of microplastic exposure was associated with a significant decrease in total sperm number [β = -15.4 (95% CI: -25.6, -5.2)], sperm concentration [β = -7.2 (95% CI: -12.4, -2.0)], and progressive motility [β = -8.3 (95% CI: -13.5, -3.1)]. Latent category analysis further refined these groups by types of microplastic exposure, highlighting specific types more strongly associated with decreased semen quality (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.8, 6.9, p < 0.001). The nomogram can be used to assess the risk of sperm damage by combining the type of microplastic exposure in urine with age and BMI. Our findings highlight the potential reproductive health risks posed by microplastic contamination, particularly PTFE, a non-stick pan coating material, and raise concerns about the potential of urine testing as an indicator of male reproductive microplastic exposure. Future research is warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of microplastics on male fertility and cross-generational effects.

"39342648","Simvastatin-Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles: Targeting Inflammatory Macrophages for Local Adipose Tissue Browning in Obesity Treatment.","Obesity is defined as chronic, low-grade inflammation within specific tissues. Given the escalating prevalence of obesity among individuals of all ages, obesity has reached epidemic proportions, posing an important public health challenge. Despite significant advancements in treating obesity, conventional approaches remain largely ineffective or involve severe side effects, thus underscoring the pressing need to explore and develop treatment approaches. Targeted and local immunomodulation using nanoparticles (NPs) can influence fat production and utilization processes. Statins, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, show the potential for mitigating obesity-related inflammation. A localized delivery option offers several advantages over oral and parenteral delivery methods. Here, we developed simvastatin (Sim) encapsulated within PLGA NPs (Sim-NP) for localized delivery of Sim to adipose tissues (ATs) for immunomodulation to treat obesity. In vitro experiments revealed the strong anti-inflammatory effects of Sim-NPs, which resulted in enhanced modulation of macrophage (MΦ) polarization and induction of AT browning. We then extended our investigation to an in vivo mouse model of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Sim-NP administration led to the controlled release of Sim within AT, directly impacting MΦ activity and inducing AT browning while inducing weight loss. Our findings demonstrated that Sim-NP administration effectively inhibited the progression of obesity-related inflammation, controlled white fat production, and enhanced AT modulation. These results highlight the potential of Sim-NP as a potent nanotherapy for treating obesity by modulating the immune system.","Neda Mohaghegh, Amir Ahari, Claire Buttles, Saya Davani, Hanna Hoang, Qiang Huang, Yixuan Huang, Bahareh Hosseinpour, Reza Abbasgholizadeh, Andrea L Cottingham, Neda Farhadi, Mohsen Akbari, Heemin Kang, Ali Khademhosseini, Vadim Jucaud, Ryan M Pearson, Alireza Hassani Najafabadi","ACS nano","2024Sep29",NA

Therefore, there is a continuous need to assess binge eating symptomatology and evaluate the effectiveness of various therapeutic interventions. The Binge Eating Scale (BES), which is a self-administered questionnaire, is widely used to assess binge eating in obese people. It examines the person' s experience of binge eating and the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms associated with it. The purpose of the present study was to translate and adapt BES in Greek, as well as to assess the factorial structure of BES and evaluate its psychometric properties. A sample of 160 participants (90% females) with a mean age of 40.7 years (SD=11.5 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) 37.5kg/m2 (SD=9.2kg/m2) completed the BES and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to assess the construct validity of the BES in a sample of patients with BED according to DSM-5 who came for therapy at the Eating Disorders Unit at Eginition Hospital and the day center ""Anasa"". The two-factor structure fits the data best. Regarding internal consistency, the results were acceptable, with Cronbach' s alpha equal to 0.78. The BES has high significant correlations with the Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern subscales and the Global Score of EDE-Q, but not with the Restrain subscale. Also, BES has correlations with the specific EDE-Q questions about the frequency of objective and subjective binge eating episodes. A high correlation was obtained with the measure of ΒΜΙ too. The Greek version of BES is a valid and reliable scale to evaluate binge eating in a clinical population diagnosed with BED.","Maria Karapatsia, Maria Evangelia Antoniadou, Chara Tzavara, Ioannis Michopoulos, Fragiskos Gonidakis","Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki","2024Sep18",NA

This exciting result, however, has been associated with an increase in the occurrence of previously unknown cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These adverse outcomes are due to both the hematologic cancer per se and to antineoplastic therapy. Cancer-dependent complications are caused by a shift of blood and endothelial cells to a prothrombotic and proinflammatory phenotype associated also with cancer-related somatic gene mutations. Antineoplastic therapy, instead, can lead to adverse outcomes due to an increase in oxidative stress resulting from the effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which can induce alterations of mitochondria and other intracellular organelles. In addition, cardiovascular complications following a hematologic malignancy are also due to the interaction between cancer and traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes.

"39342373","Sleep and nighttime behavior disorders in older adults: associations with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia at baseline, and a predictive analysis of incident cases at 12 months follow-up.","Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, are associated with dyslipidemia in the general population. The study's aim was to explore the association between pathological Cholesterol and Triglyceride levels, and sleep and nighttime behavior disorders (SNBD) in older adults, whether they might predict SNBD onset, and to emphasize the role of body mass index (BMI) in this association. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) population with complete Cholesterol, Triglyceride, SNBD, and neurocognitive data were included. Logistic regression was performed to study the association between hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and SNBD at baseline and at 12 months. Relevant confounders, particularly BMI, were adjusted for. Among the 2,216 included cases, 1,045 (47%) were females, and the median age was 73 years (IQR: 68, 78). At baseline, 357 (16%) had SNBD and 327 (18%) at 12 months; 187 of them were incident cases. There were more cases of baseline SNBD in the hypertriglyceridemia group than in those without (19% vs. 14%, P-value = 0.003). Similarly, more follow-up SNBD cases had hypertriglyceridemia at baseline (21% vs. 16%, P-value = 0.025). SNBD cases at baseline had significantly higher serum Triglyceride levels than those without (132 vs. 118mg/dL, P-value < 0.001). Only hypertriglyceridemia was significantly associated with baseline SNBD (crude OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.13,1.80, P-value = 0.003), even after adjustment for confounding factors (adj. OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.06,1.74, P-value = 0.016) and (BMI-adj. OR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.00,1.66, P-value = 0.048). None of the dyslipidemia forms did predict incident cases at 12 months. Hypertriglyceridemia, but not hypercholesterolemia, was associated with higher odds of SNBD. The association was independent of BMI. None of the dyslipidemia forms did predict incident SNBD over 12 months. Sleep disorders should motivate a systematic screening of dyslipidemia in older adults and vice versa.","Asma Hallab, NA NA","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep28","Humans; Aged; Female; Hypertriglyceridemia; Male; Hypercholesterolemia; Body Mass Index; Triglycerides; Follow-Up Studies; Sleep Wake Disorders; Alzheimer Disease; Sleep"
"39342346","A comparison of efficacy of erector spinae plane block versus serratus anterior plane block plus subcostal transversus abdominus plane block for bariatric laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery: study protocol for a randomised clinical trial.","Obesity is a rapidly growing global health concern. Limited long-term success of diet, behavioural modification and medical therapy have led to the increased performance of bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which permanently reduces the size of the stomach, has been shown to cause considerable weight loss, as well as improving or even eliminating obesity related medical comorbidities such as diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension. Unfortunately, this surgery can also result in significant postoperative pain which, when combined with the dangers of perioperative opioid administration for bariatric patients, can lead to a significantly reduced quality of recovery. Opioid-sparing analgesia has been widely recommended for perioperative bariatric patients, but research into the optimum regional analgesia approach for this surgery is lacking, with no trials to date comparing different regional analgesic techniques. This study protocol describes a randomised clinical trial aimed at answering this question, comparing the quality of recovery after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for patients who receive erector spinae plane block, versus those who receive serratus anterior plane block plus subcostal TAP block. We propose a prospective, randomised, blinded (investigator) clinical trial in a tertiary hospital in Ireland. Seventy patients presenting for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy will be randomised to two study groups-group A will receive bilateral erector spinae blockade; group B will receive left sided serratus anterior plane block plus subcostal TAP blocks. Both groups will receive the same dose of the same local anaesthetic and the different regional technique performed will be the only difference in their care. The primary outcome will be QoR-15 scores at 24 h postoperatively, a validated international tool for assessing a patient's overall postoperative recovery. Regional analgesia should be a mainstay of perioperative opioid-sparing analgesia where possible. This is especially important in the bariatric cohort who are particularly susceptible to the complications of perioperative opioid administration. To the best of our knowledge, this trial will be the first to compare efficacy of two different regional analgesia techniques for bariatric patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

"39342341","Research progress on macrophage polarization during osteoarthritis disease progression: a review.","Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that mostly affects the knee joint. It is a condition that occurs around the world. Because of the aging population and the increase in obesity prevalence, the incidence of primary OA is increasing each year. Joint replacement can completely subside the pain and minimize movement disorders caused by advanced OA, while nonsteroidal drugs and injection of sodium hyaluronate into the joint cavity can only partially relieve the pain; hence, it is critical to search for new methods to treat OA. Increasing lines of evidence show that primary OA is a chronic inflammatory disorder, with synovial inflammation as the main characteristic. Macrophages, as one of the immune cells, can be polarized to produce M1 (proinflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) types during synovial inflammation in OA. Following polarization, macrophages do not come in direct contact with chondrocytes; however, they affect chondrocyte metabolism through paracrine production of a significant quantity of inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and growth factors and thus participate in inducing joint pain, cartilage injury, angiogenesis, and osteophyte formation. The main pathways that influence the polarization of macrophages are the Toll-like receptor and NF-κB pathways. The study of how macrophage polarization affects OA disease progression has gradually become one of the approaches to prevent and treat OA. Experimental studies have found that the treatment of macrophage polarization in primary OA can effectively relieve synovial inflammation and reduce cartilage damage. The present article summarizes the influence of inflammatory factors secreted by macrophages after polarization on OA disease progression, the main signaling pathways that induce macrophage differentiation, and the role of different polarized types of macrophages in OA; thus, providing a reference for preventing and treating primary OA.","Xiangzhi Yin, Quan Wang, Yijie Tang, Tianrui Wang, Yingze Zhang, Tengbo Yu","Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research","2024Sep28","Humans; Macrophages; Disease Progression; Osteoarthritis; Animals; Cell Polarity"
"39342321","Associations between maternal diet, family eating habits and preschool children's dietary patterns: insights from the UPBEAT trial.","Dietary behaviours in early life often track across the life course, influencing the development of adverse health outcomes such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to explore the between dietary patterns (DP) in preschool children and maternal DP and family eating habits. We conducted a secondary analysis of 488 mother-child pairs from the UK pregnancy Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) at 3-year follow-up. Previously published DP from mothers and children (derived from food-frequency questionnaires and exploratory factor analysis) were used. Mothers' DP were ""Fruits-Vegetables"", ""African-Caribbean"", ""Processed and Snacks"", and children's DP were ""Prudent"", ""Processed-Snacking"", and ""African-Caribbean"". Family meal environments were evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Linear regression models revealed that child's prudent pattern was positively associated with maternal Fruits-Vegetables (B = 0.18 (0.08, 0.27)), Snacks patterns (B = 0.10 (0.01, 0.18)), and eating the same foods during meals (B = 0.25 (0.07, 0.43)). Child's Processed-Snacking pattern was directly associated with maternal Processed (B = 0.22 (0.13, 0.30)) and Snacks (B = 0.27 (0.18, 0.36)) patterns, receiving food as reward (B = 0.22 (0.04, 0.39)) and watching TV during meals (B = 0.27 (0.09, 0.45)). Finally, the child African-Caribbean pattern was directly associated with that from the mother (B = 0.41 (0.33, 0.50)) and watching TV during meals (B = 0.15 (0.09, 0.30)), and inversely associated with maternal processed (B=-0.09 (-0.17, -0.02)) and snacking (B=-0.08 (-0.15, -0.04)) patterns. Unhealthy dietary patterns in childhood are directly linked to similar maternal patterns and family meal behaviours, such as television viewing and food rewards.

Consecutive PsA patients receiving secukinumab were followed prospectively in Italian centers between 2016 and 2023. Disease characteristics, previous/ongoing treatments, comorbidities and follow-up duration were recorded. Treatment response was evaluated at 6 and 12 months after initiation, and every year up to 48 months (T48). DRR was assessed according to clinical and demographic features, comorbidities and bDMARDs line. Adverse events (AE) were recorded. Six hundred eighty-five patients [42.5% male] were enrolled; 32.9% naïve received secukinumab; 74.2% had ≥ 1 comorbidity. Overall, secukinumab yielded improved outcomes at T48: naïve maintained lower disease activity vs. non-naïve [DAPSA 4.0 (1.4-8.1) vs. 6.0 (2.2-10.4);p = 0.04]; 76.9% naïve and 66.2% non-naïve achieved MDA; MDA no comorbidities vs. 1-3 comorbidities 78.8% vs. 73.3% (p < 0.05), and MDA no comorbidities vs. > 3 comorbidities 78.8% vs. 48.7% (p < 0.001). DAPSA-REM and DAPSA-LDA rates were higher in naïve patients, albeit similar between those without comorbidities vs. 1-3 comorbidities, and slightly lower in those with > 3 comorbidities. Treatment was discontinued in 233 patients due to loss of effectiveness, and in 41 due to AE. The overall DRR at T48 was 66%, with differences according to bDMARDs line (p < 0.001), use of combined csDMARDs (p = 0.016), BMI (p = 0.037) and mono/oligoarthritis vs. polyarthritis (p = 0.012).

"39342306","Unraveling the genetic association between knee osteoarthritis and hallux deformities.","Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), hallux valgus (HV) and hallux rigidus (HR) are common musculoskeletal problems of the lower extremities. However, their underlying causal relationships are unclear. This study attempts to clarify the cause-and-effect relationship between KOA and the two common hallux deformities (HV and HR). The summary-level statistics for KOA, HV, and HR were collected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The causal analysis of KOA on HV or HR was carried out using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). In order to assess the robustness of the MR results, sensitivity analyses were performed. In addition, multivariable MR (MVMR) was implemented to assess the influence of KOA in causation as well as calibrate the effect of anthropometric characteristics. Supplementary backward MR analysis was conducted to determine the causal effect of hallux diseases on KOA. The univariable analysis indicated that KOA has a causative influence on HR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-1.41, P = 2.25E-8) and HV (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.21-1.68, P = 2.76E-5). In the backward MR analyses, hallux deformities did not appear to be the cause of KOA. In the MVMR analysis, after jointly adjusting for the effects of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and BMI, the causal impact of KOA on HV and HR remained robust. In this study, the genetic causality between KOA and increased risk of hallux deformities (HV and HR) is established, which can provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing the incidence of hallux deformities in KOA patients. Further high-level studies are warranted to validate the associations and explore its broader implications.","Zhengtao Lv, Mingchao Lin, Jiaming Zhang, KuoYang Sun, Zunwen Lin, Feng Yin, Junming Huang, Yaping Ye","Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research","2024Sep28","Humans; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hallux Valgus; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hallux Rigidus; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Female; Male"
"39342282","High free sugars, insulin resistance, and low socioeconomic indicators: the hubs in the complex network of non-communicable diseases in adolescents.","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) predominantly affect adults, but pathophysiological changes begin decades earlier, as a continuum, with initial events apparent in adolescence. Hence, early identification and intervention are crucial for the prevention and management of NCDs. We investigated the complex network of socioeconomic, behavioral, and metabolic factors associated with the presence of NCD in Brazilian adolescents. We conducted a cross-sectional study nested within the São Luís segment of the Ribeirão Preto, Pelotas, and São Luís (RPS) cohort's consortium, focusing on 18-19-year-olds (n = 2515). Data were collected prospectively, from which we constructed a complex network with NCD-related factors/indicators as nodes and their co-occurrences as edges. General and sex-based models analyzed: socioeconomic status, behavioral (smoking, alcohol, and other drugs use, unhealthy diet, poor sleep, physical inactivity), and metabolic factors (overweight/obesity, elevated blood pressure, poor lipid profile). We also looked for NCDs in adolescence like asthma, abnormal spirometry, depression, suicide risk, and poor oral health. The network was characterized by degree, betweenness, eigenvector, local transitivity, Shannon entropy, and cluster coefficient. The adolescents had an average age of 18.3 years, 52.3% were female and 47.7% male. 99.8% of them have a diet rich in free sugars, 15% are overweight/obese and 72.3% had an elevated TyG index. High free sugar emerged as the central hub, followed by high TyG index (an early marker of insulin resistance) and low socioeconomic class. In males, low fiber intake and a high triglycerides/HDL ratio highlighted cardiometabolic concerns; in females, sedentary behavior and poor sleep marked metabolic and psychological challenges, along with caries in both sexes. Our findings provide insights into central health challenges during adolescence, such as high free sugars, insulin resistance, and low socioeconomic indicators, suggesting that interventions targeted at these central hubs could have a significant impact on their NCD network.","Silas Alves-Costa, Bruno Feres de Souza, Francisco Aparecido Rodrigues, Alexandre Archanjo Ferraro, Gustavo G Nascimento, Fabio R M Leite, Lorena Lúcia Costa Ladeira, Rosângela Fernandes Lucena Batista, Erika Bárbara Abreu Fonseca Thomaz, Claudia Maria Coelho Alves, Cecilia Claudia Costa Ribeiro","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome","2024Sep28",NA

A retrospective cohort study was used to collect 260 patients with mediastinal tumors admitted to three medical centers in China from December 2020 to March 2024. These patients underwent mediastinal tumor resection by RATS (n = 125) or VATS (n = 135). Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed for the both groups, and further, the patients were divided into the N-BMI group (18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m2) and the H-BMI group (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) based on their BMI to compare patients' surgery-related information. The RATS group had more advantages than the VATS group in terms of intraoperative blood loss, total postoperative drainage, postoperative drainage time, and postoperative hospital stay. As for hospitalization costs, the VATS group was more advantageous. In the H-BMI group, subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant difference in shorter operative time and lower incidence of postoperative complications in the RATS group. RATS has technical and short-term efficacy advantages in comparison with VATS, although it has the drawback of high costs associated with the treatment of mediastinal tumors. In the patients with mediastinal tumors of H-BMI, RATS can achieve better short-term outcomes and safety, especially in the reduction of the incidence of postoperative complications.","Qing Liu, Ziqiang Hong, Wei Cao, Haochi Li, Jinlong Zhang, Xiaoyang He, Dacheng Jin, Yunjiu Gou","World journal of surgical oncology","2024Sep28","Humans; Male; Mediastinal Neoplasms; Female; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Body Mass Index; Postoperative Complications; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Length of Stay; Prognosis; Operative Time; Aged"
"39342279","Association of semaglutide treatment with coronary artery inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a retrospective study based on pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation.","The pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI) has emerged as a novel and sensitive biomarker reflecting the degree of coronary artery inflammation. Semaglutide has been demonstrated to exert a cardiovascular protective effect independent of hypoglycemia; however, its impact on coronary artery inflammation remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the association between semaglutide treatment and coronary artery inflammation based on FAI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study enrolled 497 T2DM patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at Hebei General Hospital, of whom 93 treated with semaglutide (Sema+) and 404 did not (Sema-). Clinical data, laboratory indicators, and CCTA parameters were collected and compared between the two groups at baseline. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for confounders, and pericoronary FAI was compared. Multivariate linear regression models were used to analyze the association between semaglutide treatment and pericoronary FAI. Before PSM, pericoronary FAI of the LAD and LCX was lower in patients treated with semaglutide than those without semaglutide treatment. The results of the PSM analysis revealed a lower FAI in all three major coronary arteries in the Sema + group compared to the Sema- group. Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed an independent association between semaglutide treatment and reduced FAI in all three major coronary arteries. This association varied across T2DM patients of differing profiles. Semaglutide treatment may be associated with lower coronary artery inflammation in patients with T2DM, which might partially explain its cardiovascular protective mechanism.","Yanhong Li, Wenjing Yao, Tianxing Wang, Qian Yang, Kexin Song, Feifei Zhang, Fan Wang, Yi Dang","Cardiovascular diabetology","2024Sep28","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Hypoglycemic Agents; Aged; Treatment Outcome; Glucagon-Like Peptides; Coronary Angiography; Computed Tomography Angiography; Adiposity; China; Risk Assessment; Adipose Tissue; Epicardial Adipose Tissue"
"39342273","Keys to the switch of fat burning: stimuli that trigger the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) activation in adipose tissue.","As one of the main pathogenic factors of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, the incidence of metabolic diseases such as adiposity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is increasing annually. It is urgent and crucial to find more therapeutic targets to treat these diseases. Mainly expressed in brown adipocytes, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is key to the thermogenesis of classical brown adipose tissue (BAT). Furthermore, white adipose tissue (WAT) is likely to express more UCP1 and subsequently acquire the ability to undergo thermogenesis under certain stimuli. Therefore, targeting and activating UCP1 to promote increased BAT thermogenesis and browning of WAT are helpful in treating metabolic diseases, such as adiposity and MASLD. In this case, the stimuli that activate UCP1 are emerging. Therefore, we summarize the thermogenic stimuli that have activated UCP1 in recent decades, among which cold exposure is one of the stimuli first discovered to activate BAT thermogenesis. As a convenient and efficient therapy with few side effects and good metabolic benefits, physical exercise can also activate the expression of UCP1 in adipose tissue. Notably, for the first time, we have summarized and demonstrated the stimuli of traditional Chinese medicines that can activate UCP1, such as acupuncture, Chinese herbal formulas, and Chinese medicinal herbs. Moreover, pharmacological agents, functional foods, food ingredients, and the gut microbiota are also commonly associated with regulating and activating UCP1. The identification and analysis of UCP1 stimuli can greatly facilitate our understanding of adipose tissue thermogenesis, including the browning of WAT. Thus, it is more conducive to further research and therapy for glucose and lipid metabolism disorders.","Dihong Gong, Juanhong Lei, Xudong He, Junjie Hao, Fan Zhang, Xinya Huang, Wen Gu, Xinxin Yang, Jie Yu","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep28","Uncoupling Protein 1; Humans; Thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Exercise; Cold Temperature"
"39342254","Evidence of a bi-directional relationship between heart failure and diabetes: a strategy for the detection of glucose abnormalities and diabetes prevention in patients with heart failure.","Prevalence of heart failure (HF) and diabetes are markedly increasing globally. In a population of HF patients, approximately 40% have diabetes which is associated with a more severe HF, poorer cardiovascular outcomes and higher hospitalization rates for HF than HF patients without diabetes. Similar trends were shown in HF patients with prediabetes. In addition, the association between HF and renal function decline was demonstrated in patients with or without diabetes. However, the exact prevalence of dysglycemia in HF patients requires further investigation aiming to clarify the most accurate test to detect dysglycemia in this population. The relationship between HF and diabetes is complex and probably bidirectional. In one way, patients with diabetes have a more than two-fold risk of developing incident HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction than those without diabetes. In the other way, patients with HF, when compared with those without HF, show an increased risk for the onset of diabetes due to several mechanisms including insulin resistance (IR), which makes HF emerging as a precursor for diabetes development. This article provides epidemiological evidence of undetected dysglycemia (prediabetes or diabetes) in HF patients and reviews the pathophysiological mechanisms which favor the development of IR and the risks associated with these disorders in HF patients. This review also offers a discussion of various strategies for the prevention of diabetes in HF patients, based first on fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c measurement and if normal on an oral glucose tolerance test as diagnostic tools for prediabetes and unknown diabetes that should be performed more extensively in those patients. It discusses the implementation of diabetes prevention measures and well-structured management programs for HF patients who are generally overweight or obese, as well as current pharmacotherapeutic options for prediabetes, including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors which are among the pillars of HF treatment and which recently showed a benefit in the reduction of incident diabetes in HF patients. Thus, there is an urgent need of routine screening for dysglycemia in all HF patients, which should contribute to reduce the incidence of diabetes and to treat earlier diabetes when already present.","Paul Valensi","Cardiovascular diabetology","2024Sep28","Humans; Heart Failure; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus; Prediabetic State; Risk Factors; Insulin Resistance; Prevalence; Biomarkers; Risk Assessment; Predictive Value of Tests; Hypoglycemic Agents"
"39342237","Do small effects matter more in vulnerable populations? an investigation using Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohorts.","A major challenge in epidemiology is knowing when an exposure effect is large enough to be clinically important, in particular how to interpret a difference in mean outcome in unexposed/exposed groups. Where it can be calculated, the proportion/percentage beyond a suitable cut-point is useful in defining individuals at high risk to give a more meaningful outcome. In this simulation study we compute differences in outcome means and proportions that arise from hypothetical small effects in vulnerable sub-populations. Data from over 28,000 mother/child pairs belonging to the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program were used to examine the impact of hypothetical environmental exposures on mean birthweight, and low birthweight (LBW) (birthweight < 2500g). We computed mean birthweight in unexposed/exposed groups by sociodemographic categories (maternal education, health insurance, race, ethnicity) using a range of hypothetical exposure effect sizes. We compared the difference in mean birthweight and the percentage LBW, calculated using a distributional approach. When the hypothetical mean exposure effect was fixed (at 50, 125, 167 or 250g), the absolute difference in % LBW (risk difference) was not constant but varied by socioeconomic categories. The risk differences were greater in sub-populations with the highest baseline percentages LBW: ranging from 3.1-5.3 percentage points for exposure effect of 125g. Similar patterns were seen for other mean exposure sizes simulated. Vulnerable sub-populations with greater baseline percentages at high risk fare worse when exposed to a small insult compared to the general population.

This prospective cohort study examined the association between nut consumption and the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in Korean adults. Data from two cohorts (the Ansan-Ansung and Health-Examinees) from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were used. A total of 114,140 individuals aged 40-79 years were included in the data analyses. Nut consumption was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized into four groups: non-consumers, less than 1 serving/week, 1-2 servings/week, and 2 or more servings/week (one serving was 15 g of nuts). Mortality outcomes were determined based on the 2001-2021 death records from Statistics Korea. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality across nut consumption categories. A stratified subgroup analysis by health-related variables was also performed. During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years, 4,559 deaths were recorded. After adjusting for covariates, the HR for all-cause mortality was 0.877 (95% CI = 0.772-0.996, p for trend = 0.006) in individuals with a nut consumption of 2 or more servings/week compared with that in non-consumers. Multivariable HRs for CVD mortality were 0.800 (95% CI = 0.681-0.939) in individuals consuming less than 1 serving/week, 0.656 (95% CI = 0.469-0.918) in those consuming 1-2 servings/week, and 1.009 (95% CI = 0.756-1.347) in those consuming 2 or more servings/week compared with that in non-consumers (p for trend = 0.080). No association was observed between nut consumption and cancer mortality. Stratified analysis identified significant interactions in the association between nut consumption and all-cause mortality by age, body mass index, and physical activity. Nut consumption was linearly associated with the reduced risk of all-cause mortality and showed a non-linear dose-response relationship with CVD mortality in Koreans, but had no association with cancer mortality. The effects of nut consumption, which have been inadequately investigated in this population, varied across different subgroups. These findings suggest that incorporating nuts into the diet should be encouraged for long-term health of Korean adults.","Hye Ran Shin, Jihye Kim, SuJin Song","Nutrition journal","2024Sep28","Humans; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Nuts; Male; Female; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Aged; Prospective Studies; Diet; Cohort Studies; Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models"

The thicknesses of four adipose tissues (subcutaneous, extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, and epicardial) were measured by abdominal ultrasound or echocardiography respectively. HRV was assessed by 24-hour Holter for monitoring both frequency domain indices (LF, HF, and LF/HF) and time domain indices (SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50). Mediation analysis was used toexamine whether adipose tissues mediated the relationship between T2DM and each index of HRV. Then, a latent variable - HRV burden - was constructed by structural equation model with selected HRV indices to comprehensively assess the whole HRV. Compared to non-diabetic controls, patients with T2DM exhibited a significant reduction in indices of HRV, and a remarkable increase in the thicknesses of extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, and epicardial adipose tissues. Mediation analysis found significant indirect effects of T2DM on six indices of HRV, including HF, SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, rMSSD, and pNN50, which was mediated by epicardial adipose tissue rather than other adipose tissues, with the mediation proportions of 64.21%, 16.38%, 68.33%, 24.34%, 24.10% and 30.51%, respectively. Additionally, epicardial adipose tissue partially mediated the relationship between T2DM and reduced HRV burden (24.26%), which composed by SDNN, SDNN index, rMSSD, and pNN50. Epicardial adipose tissue partially mediated the relationship between T2DM and reduced HRV, which reinforces the value of targeting heart-specific visceral fat to prevent cardiac autonomic neuropathy in diabetes.","Xiaolan Ouyang, Long Peng, Zhuoshan Huang, Tongtong Wang, Jiafu Wang, Hongxing Wu, Junlin Zhong, Bingyuan Wu, Lin Wu, Yue Li, Yan Lu, Suhua Li, Xixiang Tang","Cardiovascular diabetology","2024Sep28","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Heart Rate; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adiposity; Case-Control Studies; Aged; Mediation Analysis; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Risk Factors; Adult; Time Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adipose Tissue; Risk Assessment; Autonomic Nervous System; Intra-Abdominal Fat"
"39342192","HTLV1 infection and long term association with liver function and lipid indices; 10 years' follow-up.","Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a well-known retrovirus, particularly prevalent in northeastern Iran, where it is associated with a range of disorders, including liver dysfunction. Previous studies have demonstrated that HTLV-1 infection can alter lipid profiles, yet no research has examined lipid indices and liver function tests in these patients in the long term. This data is part of the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder (MASHAD) study. A total of 1116 participants were randomly selected, including 837 healthy individuals and 279 HTLV-1-infected patients. Following a 10-year follow-up period, Serum levels of liver enzymes were measured. Lipid indices such as the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), Body Adiposity Index (BAC), Castelli risk index (CRI-I, CRI-II), Lipid Accumulation Product (LAP), Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), and Triglyceride and HDL-C Ratio (THR) were calculated. Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis demonstrated a significant coefficient for the Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) in HTLV-infected patients compared to healthy controls (B: -0.014, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.00, p = 0.046). However, no significant differences were observed in other lipid indices between HTLV-infected patients and healthy individuals. Regarding liver enzymes, significant variations were noted in HTLV-infected patients compared to healthy controls: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (B: 2.978, 95% CI: 1.34, 4.61, p < 0.001), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) (B: 3.687, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.78, p = 0.001), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) (B: 18.232, 95% CI: 6.81, 29.65, p = 0.002), and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) (B: 3.714, 95% CI: 0.18, 7.24, p = 0.039). Individuals with HTLV-1 infection exhibit reduced VAI but elevated levels of liver enzymes such as AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT, indicating liver damage. These findings emphasize the virus's involvement in liver pathology. Also, HTLV-I is associated with reduced visceral fat tissue.","Farzam Kamrani, Amirhossein Esfandiari, Hojat Ghahvechi, Samaneh Abolbashari, Zahra Mashkat, Habibollah Esmaily, Majid Ghayour-Mobarhan, Susan Darroudi","BMC infectious diseases","2024Sep28","Humans; Male; Female; HTLV-I Infections; Middle Aged; Follow-Up Studies; Adult; Liver Function Tests; Liver; Lipids; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Iran; Aged"

Patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who underwent nephrectomy between 2013 and 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The GNRI was calculated within one week before surgery. The optimal cut-off value of GNRI was determined using X-tile software, and the patients were divided into a low GNRI group and a high GNRI group. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine prognostic factors. In addition, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed with a matching ratio of 1:3 to minimize the influence of confounding factors. Variables entered into the PSM model were as follows: sex, age, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, smoking history, BMI, tumor sidedness, pT stage, Fuhrman grade, surgical method, surgical approach, and tumor size. A total of 645 patients were included in the final analysis, with a median follow-up period of 37 months (range: 1-112 months). The optimal cut-off value of GNRI was 98, based on which patients were divided into two groups: a low GNRI group (≤ 98) and a high GNRI group (> 98). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that OS (P < 0.001), CSS (P < 0.001) and RFS (P < 0.001) in the low GNRI group were significantly worse than those in the high GNRI group. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis showed that GNRI was an independent prognostic factor of OS, CSS and RFS. Even after PSM, OS (P < 0.05), CSS (P < 0.05) and RFS (P < 0.05) in the low GNRI group were still worse than those in the high GNRI group. In addition, we observed that a low GNRI was associated with poor clinical outcomes in elderly subgroup (> 65) and young subgroup (≤ 65), as well as in patients with early (pT1-T2) and low-grade (Fuhrman I-II) ccRCC. As a simple and practical tool for nutrition screening, the preoperative GNRI can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for postoperative patients with non-metastatic ccRCC. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to validate these findings.","Huiyu Zhou, Dingyang Lv, Fan Cui, NA Qian Gong, Jinshuai Li, Jie Wen, Mohan Jia, Yinbo Kang, Yi Rong, Wenlong Zhang, Weibing Shuang","Nutrition journal","2024Sep28","Humans; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Male; Female; Propensity Score; Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Kidney Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Geriatric Assessment; Nephrectomy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Risk Factors; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Aged, 80 and over"

In this study, we developed a visualized obesity risk prediction system based on machine learning techniques, aiming to achieve personalized comprehensive health management for obesity. The system utilized a dataset consisting of 1678 anonymized health examination records, including individual lifestyle factors, body composition, blood routine, and biochemical tests. Ten multi-classification machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, were constructed to identify non-obese individuals (BMI < 25), class 1 obese individuals (25 ≤ BMI < 30), and class 2 obese individuals (30 ≤ BMI). By evaluating the performance of each model on the test set, we selected XGBoost as the best model and built the visualized obesity risk prediction system based on it. The system exhibited good predictive performance and interpretability, directly providing users with their obesity risk levels and determining corresponding intervention priorities. In conclusion, the developed obesity risk prediction system possesses high accuracy and interactivity, aiding physicians in formulating personalized health management plans and achieving comprehensive and accurate obesity management.","Jinsong Du, Sijia Yang, Yijun Zeng, Chunhong Ye, Xiao Chang, Shan Wu","Scientific reports","2024Sep28","Humans; Obesity; Machine Learning; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Risk Assessment; Body Mass Index; Risk Factors"

Our study aims to explore the relationship between CMI and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and the mediating role of body fat percentage. Utilizing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011 to 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis. We employed multiple linear regression models, subgroup analyses, generalized additive models (GAM), smooth curve fitting, and mediation analysis to evaluate the linear and nonlinear relationships between CMI and lumbar spine BMD. The study involved 5,124 participants with an average lumbar spine BMD of 1.03 ± 0.15 g/cm2. We identified a negative correlation between CMI and lumbar spine BMD (β = -0.015; 95% CI: -0.023, -0.008). Nonlinear associations were evident, with inflection points at CMI values of 1.12 and 2.86. Subgroup analyses showed consistent negative correlations across all categories without significant differences (p for interaction > 0.05). Moreover, body fat percentage negatively correlated with BMD (β = -0.005; 95% CI: -0.006, -0.004) and mediated 9.41% of the relationship between CMI and BMD. Increased CMI levels are associated with lower lumbar spine BMD, with body fat percentage significantly mediating this relationship. This underscores the importance of managing body composition in the context of bone health, highlighting CMI's potential utility in osteoporosis risk assessment.","Heng Liu, Huqiang Dong, Yu Zhou, Mingchu Jin, Haidong Hao, Yutang Yuan, Hongtao Jia","Scientific reports","2024Sep28","Humans; Bone Density; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Nutrition Surveys; Adipose Tissue; Lumbar Vertebrae; Osteoporosis; United States; Obesity; Aged; Body Mass Index"
"39341964","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and gallbladder polyp development: an observational study.","The influence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) on gallbladder polyp development in both sexes remains elusive. Therefore, to clarify the role of MASLD in gallbladder polyp development, we investigated the longitudinal association between MASLD and gallbladder polyps. In this observational study, we included 5,527 gallbladder polyp-free patients who underwent > 2 health check-ups over > 2 years. Generalized estimation equations were used to analyze associations between MASLD and gallbladder polyp development according to repeated measures at baseline and the most recent stage. Gallbladder polyp development rates in men and women were 7.5% and 5.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. MASLD was not significantly correlated with gallbladder polyp development. Regarding the association between gallbladder polyp development (men: ≥6 mm and women: ≥5 mm) and the number of MASLD components following lifestyle habits, men and women with ≥ 4 MASLD components had odds ratios of 3.397 (95% confidence interval: 1.096-10.53) and 5.338 (1.054-27.04), respectively. Higher nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis scores were associated with significant risk of gallbladder polyp development in women (1.991, 1.047-3.785). Although MASLD influence on gallbladder polyp development differs by sex, close monitoring of patients with an increasing number of MASLD components is essential to prevent gallbladder polyp development.

"39341924","Effect of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 19 and 21 on Hip Geometry and Strength in Post-menopausal Osteoporosis (PMO).","Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) receptor signalling is important for skeletal development. The FGF19 subfamily which includes FGF19 and FGF21 are involved in bone metabolism, although their effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength remain unclear. To further characterise the influence of these two factors on the skeleton, we studied the association between circulating concentrations of FGF19 and 21 with BMD and parameters of hip geometry and strength in post-menopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The study cohort consisted of 374 women aged (mean [SD]) 68.7[12.3] years with PMO. FGF19 and FGF21 were measured in serum by ELISA. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN) (n = 277) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and hip structural analysis (HSA) parameters (n = 263) at the narrow neck of the femur (NN), Intertrochanter (IT) and Femoral shaft (FS) were derived from DXA scans. FGF19 and 21 were not associated with prevalent fractures or BMD when corrected for covariates; age, BMI, smoking habits and alcohol intake. Log-transformed FGF 21 was negatively associated with HSA parameters including Outer Diameter (OD) (p = 0.019), Cross-sectional area (CSA) (p = 0.01), cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) (p = 0.011), Section modulus (Z) (p = 0.002) and cortical thickness (Co Th) (p = 0.026) at the IT only. CSA, CSMI, Z and Co Th were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in women with FGF21 concentrations greater than the median (> 103.5 pg/ml). Our data suggest that FGF 21 may have potentially adverse effects on the skeleton. Further characterisation is needed, particularly as FGF 21 analogues or agonists may be used to treat obesity-related metabolic disorders.","EunJi Kim, Amelia E Moore, Dwight Dulnoan, Geeta Hampson","Calcified tissue international","2024Sep28",NA
"39341881","Undernutrition and its determinants among children aged 6-59 months in Southern Ethiopia.","Malnutrition is responsible for over one-third of deaths among children under the age of five in low-and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia, and is largely preventable. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of undernutrition and its contributing factors among children aged 6-59 months in the Gedio zone of Southern Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was used, and data were collected from 403 children and their mothers selected through random sampling technique. Anthropometric measures were converted to Z-scores using WHO-Anthro version 3.2.2 software. The prevalence of underweight, wasting, and stunting were 19.7% (95% CI 16-24%), 10% (95% CI 7-13%), and 49% (95% CI 44-54%) respectively. Low birth weight (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI (1.585-4.895), feeding non-diversified diet (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI (1.036-3.497), and being unvaccinated (AOR: 2.0; 95%CI (1.013-4.197) were significantly associated with being underweight. Family size of ≥ 5 (AOR = 4.4, CI (1.274-5.059), meal frequency of < 3 times per a day (AOR = 2.3, CI (1.037-5.024), and index birth interval of < 24 months (AOR = 2.2, CI (1.015-4.843) were significantly associated with wasting. Similarly, children aged ≥ 24 months (AOR = 2.8, CI (1.769-4.474), feeding non-diversified diet (AOR = 1.8, CI (1.153-2.894), total duration of breast-feeding < 12 months (AOR = 4.0, CI (2.547-6.429), and mothers BMI below 18.5 (AOR = 2.2, CI (1.328-3.718) were identified as a predictors of stunting. The study revealed significant levels of undernutrition, including underweight, wasting, and stunting, among children in the study area. Factors such as birth weight, dietary diversity score, and vaccine status were found to be strongly linked to underweight. Additionally, living in a large family, meal frequency, and birth interval were significantly associated with wasting. The age of the child, duration of breastfeeding, dietary diversity score, and maternal BMI status were also significantly linked to stunting. To address this issue, the study recommends promoting healthier feeding practices, dietary diversification, optimal breastfeeding, complete vaccination, wider birth intervals, and improving maternal nutrition to reduce undernutrition among children aged 6-59 months in the area. Implementing these measures could significantly improve the health of children in the study area.","Muluken Yigezu, Taemyalewu Zenebe, Tariku Deresse, Henok Mekonnen, Tadesse Woldamanuel, Mickiale Hailu, Natnael Kebede","Scientific reports","2024Sep28","Humans; Ethiopia; Infant; Female; Male; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Malnutrition; Prevalence; Thinness; Risk Factors; Nutritional Status; Wasting Syndrome"

This study investigates the clinical characteristics and systemic inflammatory markers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Taiwan, focusing on those with anosmia/ageusia. We conducted a retrospective observational study on 231 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (alpha variant) from April to July 2021. Clinical symptoms, dyspnea grading, and laboratory investigations, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios (NLRs), platelet-lymphocyte ratios (PLRs), and ANDC scores (an early warning score), were analyzed. Cough (64.1%), fever (58.9%), and dyspnea (56.3%) were the most common symptoms, while anosmia/ageusia affected 9% of patients. Those with anosmia/ageusia were younger, had lower BMI, lower systemic inflammatory markers, and better ANDC scores than those without these symptoms. Female patients exhibited lower NLR values and ANDC scores compared to male patients (all p < 0.05). Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated significant associations between NLR and CRP and ferritin levels (all p < 0.01), and between PLR and ESR and ferritin levels (p < 0.01). Categorized ANDC scores significantly correlated with the total hospital length of stay (all p < 0.05). Despite ethnic differences in the prevalence of anosmia/ageusia, our study highlights similar clinical presentations and inflammatory profiles to those observed in Western countries. The ANDC score effectively predicted hospital stay duration. These findings suggest that anosmia/ageusia may be associated with less severe disease and a lower inflammatory response, particularly in younger and female patients. The ANDC score can serve as a valuable prognostic tool in assessing the severity and expected hospital stay of COVID-19 patients.","Jung Lung Hsu, Mei-Chuen Liu, Po-Wei Tsau, Fu-Tsai Chung, Shu-Min Lin, Mei-Lan Chen, Long-Sun Ro","Scientific reports","2024Sep28","Humans; COVID-19; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Hospitalization; Anosmia; SARS-CoV-2; Neutrophils; Adult; Ageusia; Inflammation; Lymphocytes; Taiwan; Severity of Illness Index; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome"
"39341744","Dose-dependent relationship between levothyroxine and health-related quality of life in survivors of differentiated thyroid cancer.","Long-term survival for patients with differentiated (papillary, follicular, and Hürthle cell) thyroid cancer exceeds 95% but self-reported health-related quality of life scores remain low compared with survivors of cancers with worse prognoses. There are reports that thyroid hormone replacement therapy is associated with lower health-related quality of life. This hypothesis was tested in a sample of Medicare Advantage survivors of differentiated thyroid cancer. Data were obtained from the linked 2007-2017 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer to conduct a cross-sectional study. Levothyroxine 6-month defined daily dose was calculated from claims data. Defined daily dose was classified as low, average, or high on the basis of standard deviations around body mass index-specific means. Veterans RAND 12-item Quality of Life Survey measures were categorized by T score as low health-related quality of life (T scores ≤25), moderately low (25< T scores ≤50), and high (T scores >50). The association of defined daily dose and health-related quality of life was tested using multinomial logistic regression. Among patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (n = 782), 67.5% were prescribed levothyroxine for thyroid hormone replacement therapy (mean defined daily dose 123 μg; standard deviation 44.1 μg). Greater defined daily dose was associated with greater relative risk of low (compared with moderately low) health-related quality of life on several measures including Role Limitation (relative risk, 4.9, 95% confidence interval, 2.1-11.6) and Social Functioning (relative risk, 5.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.5-12.5), as well as greater relative risk of multiple low-scoring health-related quality of life measures. Results suggest greater-than-average thyroid hormone replacement therapy dosages may be associated with lower health-related quality of life among survivors of differentiated thyroid cancer. Given the prevalence of thyroid hormone replacement therapy among survivors of differentiated thyroid cancer, thyroid hormone replacement therapy dose adjustment warrants close attention to address the functional and psychosocial well-being of patients.","Signe Braafladt, Hannah Allison, Jeanette Chung, Cary N Mariash, Oindrila Bhattacharyya, Alexandria D McDow, David A Haggstrom","Surgery","2024Sep27",NA

We investigated long-term outcomes for patients without initial progression and risk factors for upgrade. Men on AS with Gleason grade group (GG) 1 PCa on three serial biopsies, ≥5 yr without progression, and ≥10 yr of follow-up were included. Outcomes were upgrade (GG ≥2), major upgrade (GG ≥3), progression to treatment, metastasis, PCa-specific survival, and overall survival. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the associations between patient characteristics and risk of upgrade. A total of 774 men met the inclusion criteria. At 10, 12, and 15 yr, upgrade-free survival rates were 56%, 45%, and 21%; major upgrade-free survival rates were 88%, 83%, and 61%; treatment-free survival rates were 86%, 83%, and 73%; metastasis-free survival rates were 99%, 99%, and 98%; and overall survival rates were 98%, 96%, and 95%, respectively. PCa-specific survival was 100% at 15 yr. On a multivariable analysis, year of diagnosis, age, body mass index (BMI), and biopsy core positivity were associated with upgrade (all p < 0.01), whereas age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density were associated with major upgrade. Patients without progression for 5 yr on AS had modest rates of upgrade and low rates of metastasis, and mortality at 15 yr of follow-up. Year of diagnosis, older age, increased BMI, and increased biopsy core positivity were associated with upgrade, whereas older age and greater PSA density were associated with an increased risk of major upgrade. A subset of these patients may benefit from deintensification of AS protocols. There are little reported data or clinical guidelines for patients with PCa who are stable for many years on active surveillance (AS). We show, in a large cohort, that PCa patients without progression for 5 yr on AS have modest rates of upgrade and very low rates of metastasis, and mortality rates at 15 yr of follow-up, and that older age, increased body mass index, and increased PCa volume are associated with an increased likelihood of future upgrade. This study supports continued AS in this patient population and deintensification in select patients.","Kevin Shee, James Nie, Janet E Cowan, Lufan Wang, Samuel L Washington, Katsuto Shinohara, Hao G Nguyen, Matthew R Cooperberg, Peter R Carroll","European urology oncology","2024Sep27",NA

Prior studies have evaluated the role of obesity classes in cervical spine surgery in smaller patient populations. We aimed to evaluate any potential correlation to a national population sample by utilizing a large multicenter database. The purpose of this study was to analyze obesity level's influence on peri-operative complication rates in patients undergoing ACDF. A retrospective cohort, large multicenter database study. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried to identify patients who had undergone an elective ACDF procedure between 2011 and 2020 using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 22551. Medical and surgical complications within thirty days of operation. Patients were categorized into four BMI groups: non-obese (BMI 18.5-29.9 kg/m2), obese class I (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2), obese class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2), and obese class III (BMI ≥40 kg/m2). A univariate analysis conducted for demographic variables and pre-operative comorbidities identified age, sex, race, smoking status, hypertension requiring medication, diabetes, history of congestive heart failure, history of bleeding disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as risk factors. Chi-square test was used to compare incidence of complications among groups. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was subsequently performed to adjust for these preoperative risk factors and compare obesity classes I-III to non-obese patients. 64,718 patients were identified of whom 33,365 were non-obese, 17,190 were obese class I, 8,608 were obese class II, and 5,555 were obese class III. Obese classes I-III patients had a higher incidence of surgical site infections (0. 33%, 0.36%, 0.41%, vs 0.24%, p = 0.039) and pulmonary embolism (PE) (0.25%, 0.31, 0.29 versus 0.15%, p = 0.003). Obese classes I-III had a lower incidence of blood transfusion (0.23%, 0.17%, 0.27% vs 0.4%, p < 0.001) obese class I, obese class II, and obese class III independently increased the risk for PE (OR: 1.716, 95% CI (1.129-2.599); OR: 2.213, 95% CI (1.349-2.3.559); OR: 2.207, 95% CI (1.190-3.892), respectively). Risk for post-operative PEs after an ACDF was significantly higher for obese classes I-III compared to non-obese patients.

"39341572","Adipokine dysregulation as an underlying pathology for diffuse ectopic ossification of spinal posterior longitudinal ligament in patients with obesity.","Growing evidence suggests that obesity is implicated in the progression of heterotopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL), a major cause of myelopathy in Asians. However, it remains unclear whether dysregulation of adipokine production due to fat accumulation contributes to OPLL progression. To determine whether adipose-derived biochemical signals are associated with OPLL development or severity. A nationwide, multicenter, case-control study. Patients with symptomatic thoracic OPLL (T-OPLL) who received treatment between June 2017 and March 2021 and 111 controls without OPLL. OPLL severity index based on whole-spine computed tomography. Serum concentrations of adipokines, including leptin (Lep), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and adiponectin (Adpn), as well as the Adpn/Lep ratio-an indicator of adipokine production dysregulation-were compared between the multiple-region OPLL and the single-region OPLL groups. Regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation between adipokine concentrations and OPLL severity index, which was calculated using whole-spine computed tomography images of 77 patients with T-OPLL within 3 years of onset. Using propensity score matching, the adipokine profiles of 59 patients with T-OPLL were compared with those of 59 non-OPLL controls. Patients with multiple-region OPLL exhibited a higher body mass index (BMI), lower serum Adpn/Lep ratio, and higher serum concentration of osteocalcin (OCN) than those with single-region OPLL. The OPLL severity index exhibited a weak positive correlation with BMI and serum Lep levels and a weak negative correlation with the Adpn/Lep ratio. Serum TNFα and OCN concentrations were significantly higher in patients with T-OPLL than in controls with similar age, sex, and BMI. Patients with diffuse OPLL over the entire spine are often metabolically obese with low Adpn/Lep ratios. In patients with OPLL, TNFα and OCN serum concentrations were essentially elevated regardless of obesity, suggesting a potential association with OPLL development.

Birds of prey, as apex predators, are highly vulnerable to AR exposure and are widely used as biomonitors for priority pollutants in Europe. This study investigates differential SGAR exposure in raptors from insular versus continental regions, hypothesizing greater exposure in insular areas due to ecological factors like reduced prey diversity, intensive rodenticide use, and resistant rodent populations. We analyzed the livers of 190 common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and 104 common buzzards (Buteo buteo) across the Iberian Peninsula and its archipelagos using LC-MS/MS to assess their role as AR sentinels and the differences between insular and continental areas. Results revealed a high prevalence (>80%) of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs), with brodifacoum and bromadiolone, being the most frequent. Multiple SGAR detections were also common (≈50%). A binomial logistic regression showed that species and region significantly influence the likelihood of SGAR exposure. Kestrels had a greater probability of exceeding 100 ng/g wet weight (ww) compared to buzzards. Raptors from insular territories were ten times more likely to have higher SGAR concentrations than those from continental areas. However, the legal restriction on SGAR bait concentrations that came into effect in 2018 did not significantly impact exposure levels. This study highlights the need for targeted conservation efforts to mitigate AR exposure risk in vulnerable island ecosystems.","Beatriz Martín Cruz, Cristian Rial Berriel, Andrea Acosta Dacal, Ana Carromeu-Santos, Katherine Simbaña-Rivera, Sofia I Gabriel, Natalia Pastor Tiburón, Fernando González González, Rocío Fernández Valeriano, Luis Alberto Henríquez-Hernández, Manuel Zumbado-Peña, Octavio P Luzardo","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","2024Sep26",NA
"39341405","N-protein vaccine is effective against COVID-19: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.","Despite the success of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines targeting the spike (S) protein, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have led to immune escape, reducing the efficacy of these vaccines. Additionally, some individuals are unable to mount an effective immune response to S protein-based vaccines. This has created a need for alternative vaccine strategies that are less susceptible to mutations and capable of providing broad and durable protection. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel COVID-19 vaccine based on the full-length recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05726084) in Russia. Participants (n = 5229) were adults aged 18 years and older, with a BMI of 18.5-30 kg/m², and without significant clinical abnormalities. They were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of either the N protein-based vaccine (50 µg) or placebo. Randomization was done through block randomization, and masking was ensured by providing visually identical formulations of vaccine and placebo. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by PCR more than 15 days after vaccination within a 180-day observation period, analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Between May 18, 2023, and August 9, 2023, 5229 participants were randomized, with 3486 receiving the vaccine and 1743 receiving the placebo. Eight cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 occurred in the vaccine group (0.23%) compared to 27 cases in the placebo group (1.55%), yielding a vaccine efficacy of 85.2% (95% CI: 67.4-93.3; p < 0.0001). Adverse events were mostly mild and included local injection site reactions. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. The N protein-based COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated significant efficacy and a favorable safety profile, suggesting it could be a valuable addition to the global vaccination effort, particularly in addressing immune escape variants and offering an alternative for those unable to respond to S protein-based vaccines. These results support the continued development and potential deployment of N protein-based vaccines in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.","Sevastyan O Rabdano, Ellina A Ruzanova, Anastasiya E Vertyachikh, Valeriya A Teplykh, Alla B Emelyanova, German O Rudakov, Sergei A Arakelov, Iuliia V Pletyukhina, Nikita S Saveliev, Anna A Lukovenko, Liliya N Fakhretdinova, Ariana S Safi, Ekaterina N Zhirenkina, Irina N Polyakova, Natalia S Belozerova, Vladislav V Klykov, Arina P Savelieva, Aleksey A Ekimov, Konstantin V Pokachalov, Vadim A Merkulov, Sergei M Yudin, Daria S Kruchko, Igor A Berzin, Veronika I Skvortsova, NA NA","The Journal of infection","2024Sep26",NA

Standardized health data (anthropometric, laboratory, clinical, and behavioral) were collected. A hierarchical regression model was used to examine the associations based on the presence and absence of depressive symptoms. In the final model, age, gender (female), body mass index (BMI) (each kg/m2), presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes mellitus, risk of alcohol consumption, smoking status, and perceived stress were associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms. However, PA levels were associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms. The findings revealed that any level of PA was independently and significantly associated reduced risk of depressive symptoms.","Luana de Lima Queiroga, Rafael Mathias Pitta, Raphael Mendes Ritti-Dias, Paolo Marcello da Cunha, Oskar Kaufmann, Carlos André Minanni, Nelson Wolosker","Journal of affective disorders","2024Sep26",NA
"39341079","Potential therapeutic application and mechanism of gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles in polycystic ovary syndrome.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting women of reproductive age. The syndrome is characterized by androgen excess, ovarian dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR) and obesity, with an elevated risk of developing long-term complications, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The gut microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS by influencing the host's endocrine, metabolic and inflammatory state, as well as the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles (GMEVs) are lipid bilayer nanoparticles secreted by the gut microbiota and contain a variety of components, including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. They serve as signaling molecules, facilitating bacterial-bacterial and bacterial-host communications. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) affect host cells through the delivery of bioactive substances and physical interaction through membrane components, thereby participating in the regulation of metabolic, immune, and other cellular processes. Furthermore, BEVs, which are distinguished by low toxicity, high biocompatibility and stability, and the capacity to cross biological barriers, present a promising avenue for the development of novel drug delivery systems. The isolation and characterization of BEVs also facilitate the investigation of disease-specific biomarkers. Consequently, BEVs have immense potential for a range of medical research applications, including disease diagnosis and treatment. This article discusses the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of GMEVs in the treatment of PCOS.","Liangliang Yang, Tingxiu Liu, Yan Liao, Yuehan Ren, Zheng Zheng, Mingyue Zhang, Yue Yu, Chang Liu, Chaoying Wang, Tong Chen, Lili Zhang, Dongxue Zheng, Haidan Zhao, Zhexin Ni, Xinmin Liu","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","2024Sep27",NA

However, it remains unclear whether ultra-processed foods (UPF) contribute to an increased risk of NAFLD. This study aimed to explore how ultra-processed food consumption correlates with severe NAFLD using the UK Biobank data. This prospective cohort study included 143,073 participants from the UK Biobank. UPF consumption levels were determined using the NOVA classification and quantified from 24-h dietary recall data. The association between UPF consumption and severe NAFLD (hospitalization or death) was initially examined using Cox proportional hazards models with intake quartiles. Nonlinear associations were investigated using penalized cubic splines fitted in the Cox proportional hazards models. Adjustments were made for general characteristics, sociodemographic factors, body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle. Throughout the median follow-up period of 10.5 years, 1,445 participants developed severe NAFLD. The adjusted models indicated a significant increase in severe NAFLD risk in higher UPF intake groups compared to the lowest quartile (HR: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.11-1.43]). Subgroup analysis revealed that individuals with a BMI of 25 or higher were at greater risk in the highest quartile of UPF consumption. Sensitivity analyses yielded results consistent with these findings. Higher consumption of UPF is associated with an increased risk of severe NAFLD. Reducing the intake of UPF can be a potential approach to lower the risk of NAFLD.","Yi-Feng Zhang, Wanning Qiao, Jinhong Zhuang, Hanxiao Feng, Zhilan Zhang, Yang Zhang","The journal of nutrition, health & aging","2024Sep27",NA
"39340894","Correlation of mediterranean diet pattern and lifestyle factors with semen quality of men attending fertility clinics: A cross-sectional study.","While numerous studies have examined the impact of individual or combined nutrients on semen quality, research on the correlation between overall dietary patterns and semen quality remains limited. This cross-sectional study investigates the relationship between adherence to the alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED) and semen quality. A total of 274 men, presenting with both normal and abnormal semen parameters, participated in this study. Dietary data were collected using a 147-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Participants were divided into three groups based on their adherence to the Mediterranean diet (T1, T2, and T3). Statistical analyses, including ANOVA for numerical data and Chi-square tests for categorical data, were conducted. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to estimate the association between aMED scores and abnormal semen parameters. Participants in the highest adherence group (T3) were younger and had lower BMI compared to those in the other tertiles. Significant differences in sperm parameters were observed across the tertiles. T3 recorded the highest levels of sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, progressive motility, and normal morphology (57.53 ± 36.16, 213.8 ± 158.9, 73.4 ± 25.9, 61.2 ± 24.6, and 6.42 ± 1.51, respectively), whereas T1 had the lowest values (11.92 ± 22.29, 43.3 ± 73.8, 36.7 ± 33.8, 4.6 ± 5.7, respectively). No significant differences were found in semen volume and viscosity. The regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between aMED scores and sperm concentration (B = 1.32, P = 0.001), total sperm count (B = 1.12, P = 0.001), and total motility (B = 0.71, P = 0.001). Adherence to a high-quality Mediterranean diet is positively associated with improved semen quality and increased male fertility potential.

This study assessed the prevalence of high blood pressure (HBP) and associated factors among apparently healthy inschool adolescents in Delta State, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted among apparently healthy in-school adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, using a multi-stage random sampling technique. HBP was defined using the 2016 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines. Factors associated with HBP were determined using binary logistic regression. A p-value less than 0.05 was taken as significant. Of the 574 participants surveyed, 331 (57.7%) were females and 243 (42.3%) were males, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.36. The mean age of the study participants was 14.7 years. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the study participants were 118.81 (±12.703) and 70.16 (±9.972) mmHg respectively. Prehypertension and hypertension were present in 14.8% and 18.3% of the study population, respectively.

In this cross-sectional study, RA patients diagnosed per ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria were recruited. Seronegative RA was defined as ACPA < 7 kU/l. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, medications, and PROMs were collected. Serum anti-PTX3 antibodies were measured using an in-house ELISA method. Comparative analyses were conducted with historical controls having psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and fibromyalgia (FM). The cohort included 83 RA patients (42 seropositive, 41 seronegative). Seropositive patients had lower anti-PTX3 antibody levels than PsA (p= 0.001) and FM (p= 0.004) controls. Seronegative patients had higher levels than seropositive ones (p= 0.032). Anti-PTX3 antibodies correlated with CDAI (r = 0.255), PtGA (r = 0.257), VAS-GH (r=-0.235), VAS-pain (r = 0.233), and HAQ (r = 0.311), but not with joint counts, inflammatory markers, or physician's global assessment. The PtGA association remained significant when adjusted for BMI, SJC28, ESR, and prednisone dosage (β = 0.206, p= 0.042). Patients with near-controlled RA (SJC28 ≤ 2, PtGA > 2) had higher anti-PTX3 levels than those with controlled disease (SJC28 ≤ 2, PtGA ≤ 2; p= 0.048). Tocilizumab or abatacept-treated patients had lower levels compared with those on TNFi or JAKi. Elevated anti-PTX3 antibodies in RA indicate residual active disease despite controlled inflammation. They may serve as a biomarker for true active disease, especially in seronegative RA patients who might be undertreated.","Mariangela Salvato, Francesca Frizzera, Anna Ghirardello, Antonia Calligaro, Costantino Botsios, Margherita Zen, Andrea Doria, Alessandro Giollo","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","2024Sep28",NA

"39340550","Acetabular retroversion and cam morphology are contributing risk factors for posterior hip dislocation independent of the trauma mechanism.","A high-energy trauma impact is generally considered the crucial factor causing native hip dislocation. However, femoroacetabular variations are assumed to contribute to low-energy posterior hip dislocations, especially in adolescent athletes. The study aimed to analyze the femoroacetabular morphology of adults who sustained traumatic posterior hip dislocations, comparing high-energy, sports-related, and low-energy trauma mechanisms. One hundred forty-one patients with traumatic posterior hip dislocations were analyzed and matched to a control group of 141 patients with high-energy trauma mechanisms without hip or pelvic injury, matched for age, gender, and Body Mass Index (BMI). The trauma mechanism was analyzed, and the femoroacetabular morphology and concomitant femoral head or posterior acetabular wall fractures were assessed using computed tomography (CT) scans. Acetabular version, coverage, and pincer morphology were evaluated by measuring the lateral center-edge angle, acetabular index, acetabular depth/width ratio, cranial and central acetabular version angles, and the anterior and posterior acetabular sector angles (AASA, PASA). The caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle and coronal and axial alpha angles were measured to detect cam morphology. A high-energy trauma caused posterior hip dislocations in 79.4%, sports-related mechanisms in 7.8%, and a low-energy impact in 12.8%. Patients with high-energy and sports-related dislocations exhibited a higher disposition for acetabular retroversion (p < 0.001). However, the acetabular version in low-energy mechanisms did not differ from the control group (p ≥ 0.05). Acetabular retroversion was associated with isolated dislocation, while acetabular overcoverage correlated with concomitant posterior acetabular wall fractures (p < 0.05). Alpha angles were significantly increased in patients with hip dislocations, independent of the trauma mechanism (p < 0.001). Acetabular retroversion contributes to posterior hip dislocation in high-energy and sports-related trauma mechanisms and decreases the likelihood of sustaining concomitant fractures. Acetabular morphology was subordinate to causing hip dislocation following a low-energy impact. Increased alpha angles were identified as a risk factor contributing to posterior hip dislocations, regardless of the trauma mechanism.","Vera Jaecker, Stephan Regenbogen, Sven Shafizadeh, Silvan Wittenberg, Annika Steinmeier, Sven Märdian","Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery","2024Sep28",NA

Data regarding basic demographics, infertility, pregnancies, sexual function, and known factors with impact on fertility was collected. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the association between HS and infertility, adjusting for factors that influence fertility. The study population consisted of 55 patients with HS, 55 patients with other dermatological diseases (ODD), and 51 healthy controls (HC). The HS group had a higher BMI, lower sexual function, and a higher tobacco use. We found no significant difference between the three groups in terms of whether they had children, the number of children they had, infertility, or whether they had received fertility treatments. The logistic analyses found no correlation between HS and infertility, and adjusting for factors affecting infertility did not alter this result. This study did not find a significant difference in infertility between patients with HS compared to those with ODD or HC. This result was not affected by adjustments for other factors known to influence fertility.

This systematic review evaluates their intervention effects through a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Searches of 4 electronic databases until January 7, 2024, yielded 17 papers reporting on 15 RCTs involving 820 participants. Multiple-strain probiotics (MSP) showed significant efficacy in reducing BMI (Mean Difference (MD) -2.13 kg/m2, 95% credible interval (CrI) [-2.7, -1.57]), waist circumference (MD -1.34 cm, 95% CrI [-2.33, -0.35]), total cholesterol (MD -6.55 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-10.61, -2.45]), triglycerides (MD -3.71 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-5.76, -1.67]), leptin (MD -3.99 ng/mL, 95% CrI [-4.68, -3.3]), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (MD -1.21 mg/L, 95% CrI [-1.45, -0.97]). Synbiotics were effective in reducing BMI-z score (MD -0.07, 95% CrI [-0.10, -0.04]) and LDL-C (MD -1.54 mg/dL, 95% CrI [-1.98, -1.09]) but led to a slight increase in fasting glucose (MD 1.12 mg/dL, 95% CrI [0.75, 1.49]). Single-ingredient prebiotics and single-strain probiotics also had some beneficial effects on BMI and Hs-CRP, respectively. Moderate to low evidence suggests MSP may be a potential choice for improving BMI and reducing lipids, leptin, and Hs-CRP levels, implying that MSP could aid in managing pediatric obesity and related metabolic issues by modulating the gut microbiota. Although synbiotics show their favorable effects on body metrics and lipid control, their potential impact on blood glucose currently prevents them from being an alternative to MSP for treating pediatric obesity. Further large-scale, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Liang Zhang, Fang Wang, Rui Wang, Bowen Sun, Peng Ju Liu","Critical reviews in food science and nutrition","2024Sep28",NA
"39340432","Joint Modifiable Risk Factor Control and Incident Stroke in Hypertensive Patients.","Recent guidelines have recognized several factors, including blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), smoking, and physical activity, as key contributors to stroke risk. However, the impact of simultaneous management of these risk factors on stroke susceptibility in individuals with hypertension remains ambiguous. This study involved 238 388 participants from the UK Biobank, followed up from their recruitment date until April 1, 2023. Cox proportional hazard models with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to illustrate the correlation between the joint modifiable risk factor control and the stroke risk. As the degree of risk factor control increased, a gradual reduction in stroke risk was observed. Hypertensive patients who had the optimal risk factor control (≥5 risk factor controls) had a 14.6% lower stroke risk than those who controlled 2 or fewer (HR: 0.854; 95% CI: 804-0.908; p < 0.001). The excess risk of stroke linked to hypertension slowly diminished as the number of controlled risk factors increased. However, the risk was still 25.1% higher for hypertensive patients with optimal risk factor control as compared to the non-hypertensive population (HR: 1.251; 95% CI: 1.100-1.422; p < 0.001). The protective effect of joint risk factor control against the stroke risk due to hypertension was stronger in medicated hypertensive patients than in those not medicated. This finding leads to the conclusion that joint risk factor control combined with pharmacological treatment could potentially eliminate the excess risk of stroke associated with hypertension.","Xuefei Hou, Suru Yue, Zihan Xu, Xiaolin Li, Yingbai Wang, Jia Wang, Xiaoming Chen, Jiayuan Wu","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)","2024Sep28",NA
"39340326","Optimal blood pressure control with fewer antihypertensive medications: Achieved mostly in low-risk hypertensive patients.","Recent studies indicate that intensive blood pressure (BP) targets can be reached with less than two medications. This cross-sectional study, involving 4991 individuals from the Majiapu community, assessed the correlation between BP control and the burden of antihypertensive drugs. Participants on medication were categorized into controlled (BP < 140/90 mm Hg) and uncontrolled (BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) groups, with the former further divided into optimal (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) and good control (BP < 140/90 but >130/80 mm Hg) subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed factors affecting hypertension control across these BP categories. The study found that, 54% of participants had hypertension. Of those treated (62.5%), 55.7% achieved BP control, including 23.15% maintaining BP below 130/80 mm Hg. The average number of antihypertensive medications was 1.61 for the controlled group (with an average BP of 126.6/76 mm Hg) and 1.75 for the uncontrolled group (with an average BP of 150.6/84.0 mm Hg). Additionally, the average number of antihypertensive medications was 1.66 in the good control group and 1.55 in the optimal control group. The uncontrolled group had a higher mean systematic coronary risk estimation (SCORE) of 5.59, against 3.97 and 2.5 in the good and optimal control groups, respectively. Key factors linked to poor BP control included age over 65, male sex, obesity, and former smoking, whereas lipid-lowering medication use was associated with better control. In conclusions, patients needing fewer antihypertensive drugs to achieve stricter targets may have a lower risk profile. Notably, only a small proportion of treated patients are low-risk individuals who can easily achieve BP levels below 130/80 mm Hg.","Zhanyang Zhou, Huanhuan Miao, Shijie Yang, Zheng Yin, Yingjun Chen, Yuqing Zhang","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)","2024Sep28",NA

Data on medical history, lifestyle, quality of life, and cognitive function were collected. The overall prevalence of SO was 3.58% in men and 2.88% in women among 2821 participants. There was a notable increase in prevalence with age, with rates reaching 6.58% for men and 4.40% for women aged 70-79 years. In the group aged ≥80 years, the prevalence rate increased significantly, reaching 13.16% for men and 18.18% for women. Those with SO had higher body mass index (25.29 ± 1.55 kg/m² vs 24.16 ± 2.48 kg/m²; P < 0.001) and triceps skinfold thickness (21.17 ± 5.93 mm vs 19.34 ± 6.87 mm; P < 0.05) than the normal group.

Logistic regression showed that those with SO were more likely to have cardiac disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; P = 0.016) and stroke (OR = 2.61; P = 0.039). The prevalence of SO increases with age among the older adult population in China, notably after age 80 years. SO individuals were more likely to have cardiac disease and stroke. It is important to focus on early identification and management strategies.","Jing Yang, Yu Wang, Xiaodong Shi, Yan Liu, Sheng Ge, Shengqi Li, Yueming Wang, Fei Li, Pranali Suryawanshi, Wei Chen","Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition","2024Sep28",NA
"39340149","Assessing the Impact of Nicotine Dependence on 90-Day Major Complications and 2-Year Hardware Outcomes in Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of the Distal Radius Fracture.","This study aims to assess the impact of nicotine dependence on both 90-day major postoperative outcomes and 2-year implant-related outcomes in patients undergoing open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for distal radius fractures. We queried TriNetX, a national research database that provides real-time access to deidentified medical records, for patients of all ages who underwent an ORIF of the distal radius (Current Procedural Technology codes 25607, 25608, 25609) between 2001 and 2021. Patients were categorized by nicotine dependence history (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code: F17), with groups 1:1 propensity matched for age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary analysis examined major postoperative complications within 90 days, while the secondary analysis assessed hardware-related issues within 2 years. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were generated for each outcome. Of 62 137 patients treated with distal radius ORIF, 7764 had nicotine dependence, and 54 373 did not. Each group comprised 7591 patients after 1:1 matching. Nicotine dependence was associated with increased risk of skin infections, sepsis, and wound disruption in the 90-day postoperative period (P < .001). Within the 2-year postoperative period, nicotine dependence was associated with increased risk of mechanical complication of internal fixation device (P < .001), nonunion (P < .01), and surgical intervention for nonunion (P = .009). Nicotine dependence is associated with increased risk of infection, sepsis, wound disruption within 90 days, and hardware complication, nonunion, and nonunion repair at 2 years. These data emphasize the importance of nicotine counseling by treating surgeons.","Jad J Lawand, Isabel B Obias, Patrick J Tansey, John J Faillace","Hand (New York, N.Y.)","2024Sep27",NA
"39339961","Hepatocellular Carcinoma Incidences and Risk Factors in Hepatitis C Patients: Interferon versus Direct-Acting Agents.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a significant concern for patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV), even after achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) or interferon (IFN)-based therapies. This study compared the risk of HCC in patients with HCV who achieved SVR through the DAA versus IFN regimens. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 4806 HCV patients, without coinfection nor prior HCC history, treated at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan (DAA: 2825, IFN: 1981). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching (PSM) were used to adjust for baseline differences. DAA-treated patients exhibited a higher incidence of HCC than IFN-treated patients before and after PSM (after PSM: annual: 1% vs. 0.5%; 6-year: 6% vs. 3%, p = 0.01). Both DAA and IFN patients had a decreased HCC incidence during follow-up (>3 vs. <3 years from the end of treatment: DAA: 1.43% vs. 1.00% per year; IFN: 0.47% vs. 0.36% per year, both p < 0.05). HCC incidence was higher in the first three years post-SVR in DAA-treated ACLD patients and then decreased (3.26% vs. 1.39% per year, p < 0.01). In contrast, HCC incidence remained constant in the non-ACLD and IFN-treated groups. Multivariate Cox regression identified age ≥ 60, male sex, BMI, AFP ≥ 6 ng/mL, FIB-4, and ACLD status as independent risk factors for HCC, but antiviral regimens were not an independent factor for HCC. DAA treatment significantly affects HCC risk primarily within three years post-treatment, especially in younger HCV patients with ACLD. HCC incidence was reduced after three years in ACLD patients treated by DAA, but continued surveillance was still necessary. However, patients under 60 without advanced liver disease may require less intensive follow-up.","Yu-Ting Kao, Yen-Chun Liu, Ya-Ting Cheng, Yu-Wen Wen, Yi-Chung Hsieh, Cheng-Er Hsu, Chung-Wei Su, Jennifer Chia-Hung Tai, Yi-Cheng Chen, Wen-Juei Jeng, Chun-Yen Lin, Rong-Nan Chien, Dar-In Tai, I-Shyan Sheen","Viruses","2024Sep18","Humans; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Male; Female; Antiviral Agents; Middle Aged; Liver Neoplasms; Incidence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Interferons; Taiwan; Aged; Sustained Virologic Response; Adult; Hepacivirus"
"39339822","Application of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in Weight Management of Children with Spina Bifida.","Children with spina bifida (SB) face an elevated risk of obesity, which necessitates precise methods for assessing body composition to ensure effective weight management. Conventional measures like BMI are inadequate for this population because of variations in growth patterns and skeletal structure. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a method that offers a clearer picture of body composition, yet its use in children with SB remains underexplored. Conducted on 57 children with SB and 28 healthy controls, with a median age of 11 years, this study evaluated anthropometrics, including BMI and BIA-derived metrics. The Hoffer's scale to assess physical activity was applied in SB children. Results showed that while 32% of SB patients were classified as overweight or obese based on BMI, 62% exhibited high body fat percentage via BIA. Fat-free mass, muscle and fat mass, and fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR) differed significantly compared to the reference group. Non-ambulators showed a higher median body fat mass percentage (25.9% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.01) and FMR (0.92 vs. 0.44, p = 0.003) in comparison to the community walkers. In SB children, BIA-measured fat mass is a better obesity indicator than BMI. Non-ambulatory, SB patients with obesity had the highest FMR values, indicating a higher risk for metabolic syndrome.","Joanna Bagińska-Chyży, Agata Korzeniecka-Kozerska","Nutrients","2024Sep23","Humans; Spinal Dysraphism; Electric Impedance; Child; Female; Male; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Adolescent; Pediatric Obesity; Case-Control Studies"
"39339821","Association between Visceral Adiposity Index and Hyperuricemia among Steelworkers: The Moderating Effects of Drinking Tea.","Steelworkers are more likely to have a higher prevalence of hyperuricemia due to their exposure to special occupational factors and dietary habits. The interrelationships of visceral adiposity index (VAI), hyperuricemia, and drinking tea remain uncertain. This study aimed to assess the association between VAI and hyperuricemia among steelworkers, and if drinking tea modified this association. A total of 9928 steelworkers from Hunan Hualing Xiangtan Iron and Steel Company participated in this cross-sectional study. All participants completed a questionnaire, received anthropometric measurements, and provided blood samples for biochemical testing. Three logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between VAI and hyperuricemia. In this study, the prevalence of hyperuricemia was approximately 23.74% (males: 24.41%; females: 20.63%), and a positive correlation between VAI and hyperuricemia risk was observed. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of hyperuricemia increased 1.76 times (95% CI: 1.64-1.89) and 2.13 times (95% CI: 1.76-2.57) with the increase of ln VAI in males and females, respectively. For males, compared to quartile 1, the risk of hyperuricemia in the second, third, and fourth quartile of VAI were 1.75 (95% CI: 1.11-2.71), 2.56 (95% CI: 1.67-3.93) and 4.89 (95% CI: 3.22-7.43). For females, compared to quartile 1, the risk of hyperuricemia in the second, third, and fourth quartile of VAI were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.40-2.82), 2.92 (95% CI: 1.96-4.34) and 4.51 (95% CI: 2.89-7.02). Additionally, our study found that, compared with not consuming tea, drinking tea could reduce uric acid levels by 0.014 in male steelworkers (t = -2.051, p = 0.040), 0.020 in workers consuming smoked food (t = -2.569, p = 0.010), and 0.022 in workers consuming pickled food (t = -2.764, p = 0.006). In conclusion, VAI is positively correlated with hyperuricemia in steelworkers. Drinking tea may lower uric acid levels in male steelworkers and steelworkers who prefer smoked and pickled foods.","Xun Huang, Zixin Zhong, Junwei He, Seydaduong Them, Mengshi Chen, Aizhong Liu, Hongzhuan Tan, Shiwu Wen, Jing Deng","Nutrients","2024Sep23","Humans; Male; Hyperuricemia; Female; Tea; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Steel; Obesity, Abdominal; Intra-Abdominal Fat; China; Logistic Models; Young Adult"
"39339820","Exploring the Effect of an Obesity-Prevention Intervention on Various Child Subgroups: A Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis of the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study.","This study investigated potential subgroups of children within the Kiel Obesity Prevention Study (KOPS) for differing treatment effects for the outcome measures of overweight or obesity at 4 years. The KOPS study delivered a multicomponent school intervention to cohorts of children in Kiel but found no overall effect on the weight status outcome. However, KOPS authors suggested there may be subgroup variations in treatment effect. Data were collected as part of the KOPS for samples of 6-year-olds between 1996 and 2001, with 4-year follow-up measurements between 2000 and 2004. The present study conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of the odds of obesity or overweight at 4-year follow-up compared to normal weight (n = 1646). A generalized linear mixed-effects model, including a treatment-subgroup interaction term, was used to estimate subgroups as a moderator of the treatment effects on the outcomes of obesity or overweight at 4-year follow-up. The findings indicated several subgroup-treatment interaction effects relating to physical activity indicators. TV or PC not being one of a child's top 3 activities at baseline was associated with a significantly decreased odds ratio of obesity at 4 years in the intervention group (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.45) compared to the non-intervention group (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.29 to 3.14), p = 0.02. Weekly activity in a sports club at baseline was associated with a decreased odds ratio of overweight at 4 years in the intervention group (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.85) compared to the non-intervention group (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.17). This was a significant difference (p = 0.04). These findings suggest that children's baseline physical activity may impact treatment effects on the outcomes of overweight and obesity, creating opportunities to increase the effectiveness of interventions on preventing obesity.","Elizabeth Mannion, Kristine Bihrmann, Sandra Plachta-Danielzik, Manfred J Müller, Anja Bosy-Westphal, Christian Ritz","Nutrients","2024Sep23","Humans; Male; Female; Child; Pediatric Obesity; Exercise; Child, Preschool; Follow-Up Studies; School Health Services; Overweight; Body Mass Index; Odds Ratio"
"39339816","The Influence of Non-Pharmacological and Pharmacological Interventions on the Course of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.","Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) includes autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive (ARPKD) forms, both of which are primary genetic causes of kidney disease in adults and children. ADPKD is the most common hereditary kidney disease, with a prevalence of 329 cases per million in Europe. This condition accounts for 5-15% of end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESKD) cases, and in developed countries such as Poland, 8-10% of all dialysis patients have ESKD due to ADPKD. The disease is caused by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, with PKD1 mutations responsible for 85% of cases, leading to a more aggressive disease course. Recent research suggests that ADPKD involves a metabolic defect contributing to cystic epithelial proliferation and cyst growth. Aim: This review explores the interplay between metabolism, obesity, and ADPKD, discussing dietary and pharmacological strategies that target these metabolic abnormalities to slow disease progression. Conclusion: Metabolic reprogramming therapies, including GLP-1 analogs and dual agonists of GIP/GLP-1 or glucagon/GLP-1 receptors, show promise, though further research is needed to understand their potential in ADPKD treatment fully.","Karolina Kędzierska-Kapuza, Inga Łopuszyńska, Grzegorz Niewiński, Edward Franek, Małgorzata Szczuko","Nutrients","2024Sep23","Humans; Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant; Disease Progression; Obesity; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; TRPP Cation Channels"

Identifying characteristics that predict a higher risk of fibrosis using noninvasive methods is particularly important. We performed a secondary analysis of data from an RCT of 48 patients after one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgery, supplemented with specifically formulated probiotics and micronutrients or control treatment for 12 weeks. Patients were categorized using alanine aminotransferase (ALAT; >35 U/L for women, >50 U/L for men), higher NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) > -1.455), and IR (HOMA-IR > 2.0). This trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT03585413). Abnormal ALAT was associated with high triglycerides, blood pressure (BP), glucose, and fatty liver index (FLI). NFS > -1.455 was linked to higher age, body mass, waist circumference, and FLI, and lower albumin and platelet count. HOMA-IR > 2.0 was associated with higher BP and triglycerides, lower HDL-cholesterol, higher serum transaminases, and higher probabilities of steatosis and fibrosis. Twelve weeks postoperatively, patients with NFS > -1.455 showed greater reductions in body mass, systolic BP, serum insulin, and HbA1c, whereas those with NFS ≤ -1.455 showed improvements in FLI and lipid metabolism but had high glucose concentrations. Patients with HOMA-IR ≤ 2.0 also had high glucose concentrations. The evaluation of common biomarker scores for fibrosis and IR may help clinicians to recognize severe NAFLD and improve the outcomes of OAGB surgery.","Silke Crommen, Karl Peter Rheinwalt, Andreas Plamper, Daniela Rösler, Leonie Weinhold, Christine Metzner, Sarah Egert","Nutrients","2024Sep23","Humans; Female; Male; Gastric Bypass; Middle Aged; Adult; Insulin Resistance; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prognosis; Obesity; Alanine Transaminase; Obesity, Morbid; Liver Cirrhosis; Blood Glucose"
"39339803","The Impact of Body Composition on Mortality and Hospital Length of Stay after Endovascular and Open Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A Retrospective Cohort Study.","Background: Sarcopenia is an indicator of preoperative frailty and a patient-specific risk factor for poor prognosis in elderly surgical patients. Some studies have explored the prognostic significance of body composition parameters in relation to perioperative mortality after aortic repair and to mid- and long-term survival following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the effects of various body composition parameters, including but not limited to sarcopenia, on short- and long-term mortality as well as the length of hospital stay in two large cohorts of patients undergoing open surgical aortic repair (OSR) or EVAR. Methods: A single-institution retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent EVAR or OSR from January 2010 to December 2017. Several parameters of body composition on axial CT angiography images were analyzed, such as skeletal muscle area (SMA) with derived skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Results: 477 patients were included: 250 treated by OSR and 227 by EVAR; the mean age was 70.8 years (OSR) and 76.3 years (EVAR), with a mean follow-up of 54 months. Sarcopenia was associated with a prolonged length of hospital stay in EVAR patients but not in OSR patients (β coefficient 3.22; p-value 0.022 vs. β coefficient 0.391; p-value 0.696). Sarcopenia was an elevated one-year mortality risk post-EVAR compared to those without sarcopenia (p-value for the log-rank test 0.05). SMA and SMI were associated with long-term mortality in EVAR patients even after adjusting for multiple confounders (HR 0.98, p-value 0.003; HR 0.97, p-value 0.032). The analysis of the OSR cohort did not show a significant correlation between short- and long-term mortality and sarcopenia indicators. Conclusions: The results suggest that body composition could predict increased mortality and longer hospital stays in patients undergoing EVAR procedures. These findings were not confirmed in the cohort of patients who underwent OSR. Patients with sarcopenia and pre-operative malnutrition should be critically assessed to define the indication for treatment in this predominantly elderly and morbid cohort, despite EVAR procedures being less invasive. Body composition evaluation is an inexpensive and reproducible tool that can contribute to an improved decision-making process by identifying patients who will benefit most from EVAR, ensuring a more personalized and cost-effective treatment strategy. Further studies are planned to explore the added value of integrating body composition into a comprehensive risk stratification before aortic surgery.","Rosaria Del Giorno, Alessandro Robaldo, Alessia Astorino, Luca Gabutti, Vito Chianca, Stefania Rizzo, Francesca Riva, Ludovica Ettorre, Kevyn Stefanelli, Reto Canevascini, Luca Giovannacci, Giorgio Prouse","Nutrients","2024Sep22","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Aged; Male; Female; Endovascular Procedures; Length of Stay; Body Composition; Sarcopenia; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm; Middle Aged"
"39339796","Common Bean Suppresses Hepatic Ceramide Metabolism in a Mouse Model of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.","Background/Objectives: The incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a condition linked to the ongoing obesity pandemic, is rapidly increasing worldwide. In turn, its multifactorial etiology is consistently associated with low dietary quality. Changing dietary macronutrient and phytochemical quality via incorporating cooked common bean into an obesogenic diet formulation has measurable health benefits on the occurrence of both obesity and hepatic steatosis in C57BL/6 mice. Methods: A cohort of C57BL/6 mice were randomized into experimental diets containing multiple dietary concentrations of common bean. The primary endpoint of this study was comparing metabolomic analyses from liver and plasma of different treatment groups. Additionally, RNA sequencing and protein expression analysis via nanocapillary immunoelectrophoresis were used to elucidate signaling mediators involved. Results: Herein, global metabolomic profiling of liver and plasma identified sphingolipids as a lipid subcategory on which bean consumption exerted significant effects. Of note, C16 and C18 ceramides were significantly decreased in bean-fed animals. Hepatic RNAseq data revealed patterns of transcript expression of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism that were consistent with metabolite profiles. Conclusions: Bean incorporation into an otherwise obesogenic diet induces effects on synthesis, biotransformation, and degradation of sphingolipids that inhibit the accumulation of ceramide species that exert pathological activity. These effects are consistent with a mechanistic role for altered sphingolipid metabolism in explaining how bean inhibits the development of MASLD.","Vanessa K Fitzgerald, Tymofiy Lutsiv, John N McGinley, Elizabeth S Neil, Mary C Playdon, Henry J Thompson","Nutrients","2024Sep21","Animals; Ceramides; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Liver; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Male; Fatty Liver; Obesity; Sphingolipids; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Phaseolus; Metabolomics; Diet"
"39339791","Daily Orange Consumption Reduces Hepatic Steatosis Prevalence in Patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: Exploratory Outcomes of a Randomized Clinical Trial.","Background: Consumption of flavonoid-rich orange juice has been shown to reduce adiposity and liver steatosis in murine models of diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about the effects of whole orange intake, independent of body weight changes, on liver function and steatosis in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The goal is to understand the direct impact of orange consumption on metabolic health. Methods: Sixty-two men and women aged 30-65 with MASLD (Controlled Attenuation Parameter, (CAP) > 275 dB/m) were randomly assigned to consume either 400 g of whole oranges or non-citrus fruits daily for 4 weeks. Baseline evaluations included medical assessments, blood tests, and body composition. Liver health was assessed using transient elastography (FibroScan®) for steatosis and fibrosis, conducted by blinded personnel. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05558592). Results: After 4 weeks of orange supplementation, liver steatosis decreased in the treatment group, with 70.9% showing steatosis compared to 100% in controls (p < 0.004), indicating a 30% reduction in liver disease prevalence. There were no significant changes in fibrosis or plasma liver enzymes, though plasma gamma glutaril transferase (GGT) levels decreased significantly. Body weight, waist circumference, body composition, lipid profile, fasting glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein levels remained unchanged. Dietary analysis revealed no change in caloric intake, but vitamins C, A, thiamine, and riboflavin increased in the orange group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that phytochemical-rich foods, especially whole fruits like oranges, may enhance liver function as an adjunct treatment for MASLD. The notable reduction in liver steatosis prevalence occurred independently of body weight changes. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of orange supplementation on steatosis and fibrosis progression and to identify the specific bioactive compounds and mechanisms involved.","Maria Notarnicola, Valeria Tutino, Valentina De Nunzio, Anna Maria Cisternino, Miriam Cofano, Rossella Donghia, Vito Giannuzzi, Marianna Zappimbulso, Rosa Anna Milella, Gianluigi Giannelli, Luigi Fontana","Nutrients","2024Sep20","Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Citrus sinensis; Adult; Aged; Prevalence; Fatty Liver; Liver; Fruit and Vegetable Juices; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Fruit; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"

However, alterations in body composition, particularly among young women (<40 years), remain largely unknown and underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of computed tomography (CT)-derived body composition with mortality rates among young women recently diagnosed with breast cancer, identifying the best-correlated cutoff value. Methods: This is a bi-set cohort study with retrospective data collection. Women newly diagnosed with ductal invasive breast cancer, aged 20 to 40 years, treated in reference oncology units were included. Body composition was assessed using CT scans at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) level, including muscle and adipose compartments. The outcome of interest was the incidence of overall mortality. A maximally selected log-rank Cox-derived analysis was employed to assess the cutoffs associated with mortality. Results: A total of 192 women were included before any form of treatment (median age of 35 years, IQ range: 31-37). Overall mortality occurred in 12% of the females. Stages III-IV were the most frequent (69.5%). Patients who died had a significantly lower muscle area index. CT-derived muscle area was inversely associated with mortality. Each 1 cm2/m2 decrease in skeletal muscle index increased the mortality hazard by 9%. Higher values of adiposity compartments were independently associated with higher mortality.

While multiple expert groups have expressed concern about their use, it is not known how commonly they are consumed and whether they impact energy intake or body mass index (BMI). The objectives were to describe pouch use, and determine associations with energy intake and BMI, in infants and young children. In this observational cross-sectional study of 933 young New Zealand children (6.0 months-3.9 years), pouch use was assessed by a questionnaire ('frequent' use was consuming food from a baby food pouch ≥5 times/week in the past month), usual energy intake using two 24-h recalls, and BMI z-score calculated using World Health Organization standards. The sample broadly represented the wider population (27.1% high socioeconomic deprivation, 22.5% Māori). Frequent pouch use declined with age (infants 27%, toddlers 16%, preschoolers 8%). Few children were both frequent pouch users and regularly used the nozzle (infants 5%, toddlers 13%, preschoolers 8%). Preschoolers who were frequent pouch users consumed significantly less energy than non-users (-580 kJ [-1094, -67]), but infants (115 [-35, 265]) and toddlers (-206 [-789, 378]) did not appear to have a different energy intake than non-users.

While the essential role of nutritional and dietary strategies in HF patients is acknowledged in the existing scientific guidelines and clinical practice, there are no comprehensive nutritional recommendations for optimal dietary management of HF. In this review, we discuss results from recent studies on the obesity paradox and the effects of calorie restriction and weight loss, intermittent fasting, the Western diet, the Mediterranean diet, the ketogenic diet, and the DASH diet on HF progression. Many of these strategies remain under clinical and basic investigation for their safety and efficacy, and there is considerable heterogeneity in the observed response, presumably because of heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of different types of HF. In addition, while specific aspects of cardiac metabolism, such as changes in ketone body utilization, might underlie the effects of certain dietary strategies on the heart, there is a critical divide between supplement strategies (i.e., with ketones) and dietary strategies that impact ketogenesis.

Patients with MSUD who were over 3 years old, not treated with liver transplantation, and who provided written consent, were included. The study aimed to describe the dietary treatment of patients with MSUD, evaluate growth data, and analyze the effect of a low-protein and semi-synthetic diet on body composition. Data on height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, food intake, physical activity, and DEXA scans were collected. Thirteen subjects (11 classic MSUD, 2 intermediate MSUD) were included, of which 5 < 18 years old. Results indicated that patients with MSUD follow a balanced diet and have body compositions like healthy subjects in terms of fat and lean mass.

"39339743","Disparities in the Cardiometabolic Impact of Adiposity among African American and Hispanic Adolescents.","As adiposity increases in youth, so does the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs). The etiology of adiposity-based chronic disease and CMRFs includes ethnoracial disparities that are rarely considered in current treatment approaches. Precision interventions require further characterization of these disparities among high-risk youth. The objective of this study was to characterize differences in CMRF among African American (AA) and Hispanic (H) adolescents with varying levels of adiposity. A cross-sectional analysis of 2284 adolescents aged 12-17 was conducted using 3-year clinical data from Lifedoc Health. CMRF prevalence were compared using χ2, with logistic regression models (LRM) applied to explore the relationships between exposures (age, sex, ethnoracial group, adiposity) and CMRF outcomes. Prevalence of CMRF rose with increasing adiposity, which was the strongest determinant of risk overall. However, individual risk profiles differed between the two groups, with H having higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), higher triglycerides and liver enzymes, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Meanwhile, AA had higher prevalence of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the overweight category, prediabetes in overweight to severe obesity, and type 2 diabetes in obesity. LRM showed 3.0-fold greater chance of impaired glucose metabolism in AA than H, who were 1.7, 5.9, and 8.3 times more likely to have low HDL-c, high liver enzymes, and high triglycerides, respectively. Overweight/obesity prevalence was very high among AA and H adolescents. Excess adiposity was associated with an increased prevalence of CMRF, with individual risk factors differing between groups as adiposity increased. Research within routine clinical settings is required to better characterize these discrepancies and ameliorate their adverse impact on health in the transition to adulthood.","Pedro A Velásquez-Mieyer, Ramfis Nieto-Martinez, Andres E Velasquez, Xichen Mou, Stephanie Young-Moss, Jeffrey I Mechanick, Cori Cohen Grant, Claudia P Neira","Nutrients","2024Sep18","Humans; Adolescent; Black or African American; Adiposity; Hispanic or Latino; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Child; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Prevalence; Metabolic Syndrome; Health Status Disparities; Pediatric Obesity; Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases"
"39339739","Dietary Habits, Physical Activity and Body Mass Index in Transgender and Gender Diverse Adults in Italy: A Voluntary Sampling Observational Study.","Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals continue to experience harassment and discrimination across various aspects of life, significantly impacting their physical and mental health. The scarcity of data on their general health, particularly regarding dietary habits, remains a challenge in developing effective healthcare strategies for this population. To address this gap, we analyzed selected dietary habits, physical activity (PA), and body mass index (BMI) among Italian TGD adults compared to the Italian general population (IGP). An online anonymous survey was conducted via the Computer Assisted Web Interviewing technique from June 2020 to June 2021. Participants were enrolled through clinical centers and TGD organizations. Data from 959 TGD adults were analyzed using chi-squared tests and logistic regression models. Key findings indicated that approximately 70% of TGD individuals consumed fewer servings of fruit and vegetables (FV) than recommended (five or more servings per day). Although red meat consumption was lower overall, a greater percentage of TGD individuals reported consuming more than three servings per week. Additionally, 58% of TGD participants indicated that they did not engage in any PA, compared to 36% of the IGP. Notably, significant differences in BMI were identified, with higher rates of overweight and obesity among TGD individuals assigned female at birth. These results underscore the urgent need for tailored nutritional guidelines and inclusive public health strategies to meet the specific health needs of the Italian TGD population. Expanding access to targeted interventions could contribute to improving overall well-being in this marginalized group.","Carmela Santangelo, Matteo Marconi, Angela Ruocco, Jiska Ristori, Stefania Bonadonna, Rosario Pivonello, Maria Cristina Meriggiola, Francesco Lombardo, Giovanna Motta, Chiara Michela Crespi, Maddalena Mosconi, Alessandro Oppo, Silvia Federici, Luca Bruno, Nunzia Verde, Alessandra Lami, Emanuela Bologna, Rosaria Varì, Maria Teresa Pagano, Luciana Giordani, Paola Matarrese, Flavia Chiarotti, Alessandra Daphne Fisher, Marina Pierdominici","Nutrients","2024Sep17","Humans; Italy; Female; Body Mass Index; Male; Adult; Exercise; Transgender Persons; Feeding Behavior; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Diet; Obesity; Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent"
"39339733","The Role of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 5 (Sfrp5) in Overweight and Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence.","Background/Objective: Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) is an anti-inflammatory adipokine that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity and its metabolic complications. Despite the fact that numerous studies have been carried out in adults, limited data on Sfrp5 exist for youth, especially in relation to overweight and obesity. Methods: In our study, we assessed the concentrations of Sfrp5, total oxidative (TOS) and antioxidative (TAS) status, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and several cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-α) in 120 children and adolescents (mean age ± SE: 11.48 ± 0.25 years; 48 prepubertal, 72 pubertal; 74 males and 46 females) before and 1 year after the implementation of a personalized, structured, lifestyle intervention program of healthy diet, sleep, and physical exercise. Results: Based on the body mass index (BMI), participants were categorized as having morbid obesity (n = 63, 52.5%), obesity (n = 21, 17.5%), overweight (n = 22, 18.33%), or normal BMIs (n = 14, 11.67%), based on the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-off points. Following the 1-year lifestyle intervention program, a significant improvement in anthropometric measurements (BMI, BMI-z score, diastolic blood pressure, WHR, and WHtR), body-composition parameters, hepatic enzymes, lipid profile, inflammation markers, and the insulin-sensitivity profile (HbA1C, HOMA index) was observed in all subjects. Sfrp5 decreased in subjects with obesity (p < 0.01); however, it increased significantly (p < 0.05) in patients with morbid obesity. Linear regression analysis indicates that TNF-α and systolic blood pressure were the best positive predictors and hs-CRP was the best negative predictor for Sfpr5 concentration at initial assessment and glucose concentration for ΔSfrp5, while TNF-α and TAS were the best positive predictors for Sfpr5 concentration at annual assessment. Conclusions: These results indicate that Sfrp5 is associated with severe obesity and is increased following weight loss in children and adolescents with morbid obesity. It is also related to metabolic homeostasis, as well as inflammation and oxidative status.","Diamanto Koutaki, George Paltoglou, Maria Manou, Aikaterini Vourdoumpa, Eleni Ramouzi, Anastasia-Maria Tzounakou, Athanasios Michos, Flora Bacopoulou, Emilia Mantzou, Emmanouil Zoumakis, Marina Papadopoulou, Penio Kassari, Evangelia Charmandari","Nutrients","2024Sep17","Humans; Male; Female; Adolescent; Child; Pediatric Obesity; Body Mass Index; Cytokines; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; C-Reactive Protein; Eye Proteins; Overweight; Membrane Proteins; Biomarkers; Oxidative Stress; Antioxidants; Exercise"
"39339719","The Impact of Ten Days of Periodic Fasting on the Modulation of the Longevity Gene in Overweight and Obese Individuals: A Quasi-Experimental Study.","Fasting potentially alters the aging process induced by obesity by regulating telomere integrity, which is related to longevity genes. However, the impact of periodic fasting (PF) on the expression of longevity genes, particularly Forkhead Box O Transcription Factors (FOXO3a) and the Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT), is not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the effects of PF, specifically on FOXO3a, hTERT expression, and other associated factors. A quasi-experimental 10-day study was conducted in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. This study consisted of an intervention group (PFG), which carried out PF for ten days using a daily 12 h time-restricted eating protocol, and a control group (CG), which had daily meals as usual. FOXO3a and hTERT expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time qPCR. A paired t-test/Wilcoxon test, independent t-test/Mann-Whitney U-test, and Spearman's correlation test were used for statistical analysis. Thirty-six young men participated in this study. During the post-test period, FOXO3a expression in the PFG increased 28.56 (±114.05) times compared to the pre-test, but the difference was not significant. hTERT expression was significantly higher in both the CG and PFG. The hTERT expression in the PFG was 10.26 (±8.46) times higher than in the CG, which was only 4.73 (±4.81) times higher. There was also a positive relationship between FOXO and hTERT in the CG. PF significantly increased hTERT expression in the PFG; however, no significant increase was found in FOXO3a expression. PF regimens using the 12 h time-restricted eating approach may become a potential strategy for preventing obesity-induced premature aging by regulating longevity gene expression.","Nurma Yuliyanasari, Eva Nabiha Zamri, Purwo Sri Rejeki, Muhammad Miftahussurur","Nutrients","2024Sep15","Humans; Fasting; Male; Forkhead Box Protein O3; Longevity; Obesity; Telomerase; Overweight; Adult; Young Adult; Indonesia; Gene Expression Regulation"
"39339703","Is Obesity a Problem in New Cystic Fibrosis Treatments?","Malnutrition has always been a problem in CF (cystic fibrosis) patients; however, new treatments with CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein) modulators have led to weight gain, with some patients at risk of overweight and obesity. Our study aimed to analyze the evolution of BMI (body mass index) after one year of treatment with triple therapy and the factors associated with weight gain in CF patients undergoing treatment with triple therapy with CFTR protein modulators (ETI) (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). We conducted a prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter study in patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, aged 18 years or older, with at least one F508del allele and who underwent ETI therapy for at least one year, from 2020 to 2023. One hundred and eight patients from two cystic fibrosis units in Spain, Princess University Hospital of Madrid (74 patients) and Central University Hospital of Asturias (HUCA) (34 patients), were included. Demographic data, anthropometric data, lung function, and exacerbations were collected, comparing the data in the previous year to the start of therapy with the results after one year of treatment. Multivariant models were developed to account for repeated weight and BMI measurements, using a mixed effects model approach and accounting for possible modifying factors Results: One hundred and eight patients were included in the study, 58 men (53.7%) and 50 women (46.3%) with a mean age of 29.5 ± 9.4 years (18-59). Patient weight and BMI were recorded at baseline and at 3-month intervals during the study period. The weight increased from 59.6 kg to 62.6 kg and BMI increased from 21.9 kg/m2 to 23.0 kg/m2 after one year of treatment (p < 0.0001 for both). The proportion of underweight individuals decreased after one year of ETI therapy, from 9.3% to 1.9%, while the proportion of overweight or obese individuals increased from 8.3% to 22.9 % at the same time (p < 0.001). In relation to exacerbations, there is a significant increase in the number of patients who did not have any exacerbations after one year of treatment, which increased from 10.2% to 46.2% (p < 0.001), while the number of patients who had >4 exacerbations decreased significantly, from 40.7% to 1.9% (p < 0.001). FEV1% (forced expiratory volume) increased from 63.9 ± 20.9 to 76.8 ± 21.4 (p < 0.001) and the VR/TLC (residual volume/total lung capacity) value decreased from 45.1 ± 10.9 to 34.9 ± 6.2 (p < 0.001). The proportion with FEV1% > 80% increased from 23.1% before ETI therapy to 49.1% one year after ETI therapy. We performed multivariate mixed models to evaluate the evolution of BMI changes with time, accounting for repeated measures and for possible modifying factors. After the introduction of the triple therapy, patients included in the study had significant weight gain during the 12 months, and when including different covariates in the multivariate mixed model, we found that lower baseline BMI, lower baseline FEV1 and FVC (forced vital capacity), and higher VR/TLC value and higher number of exacerbations were associated with higher BMI changes over the study period. CF patients treated with triple therapy experience significant weight gain, increasing the proportion of overweight patients. CF patients who experienced greater weight gain were those with worse BMI at the start of treatment, as well as patients with worse lung function and a greater number of exacerbations in the year before starting ETI therapy.","Marta Solís-García, Marta María García-Clemente, Claudia Janeth Madrid-Carbajal, Adrián Peláez, Rosa Mar Gómez Punter, Jose María Eiros Bachiller, Rosa María Girón Moreno","Nutrients","2024Sep14","Humans; Cystic Fibrosis; Female; Male; Adult; Prospective Studies; Obesity; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Body Mass Index; Longitudinal Studies; Young Adult; Aminophenols; Indoles; Quinolones; Weight Gain; Adolescent; Benzodioxoles; Pyridines; Pyrazoles; Drug Combinations; Pyrrolidines; Spain"

Meat consumption is a growing trend and white meat has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the dose-response relationship between white meat intake and MASLD at survey level in a Southern Italy setting. (2) Methods: This cross-sectional study encompassed 1192 subjects (509 males, 42.7%) without missing data from the second wave of the NUTRIHEP cohort (2014-2016).

A major contributor is the consumption of high-fat diets, an increasingly common feature of modern diets. Maternal obesity results in an increased risk of offspring developing obesity and related health problems; however, the impact of maternal diet on the adipose tissue composition of offspring has not been evaluated. Here, we designed a generational diet-induced obesity study in female C57BL/6 mice that included maternal cohorts and their female offspring fed either a control diet (10% fat) or a high-fat diet (45% fat) and examined the visceral adipose proteome. Solubilizing proteins from adipose tissue is challenging due to the need for high concentrations of detergents; however, the use of a detergent-compatible sample preparation strategy based on suspension trapping (S-Trap) enabled label-free quantitative bottom-up analysis of the adipose proteome. We identified differentially expressed proteins related to lipid metabolism, inflammatory disease, immune response, and cancer, providing valuable molecular-level insight into how maternal obesity impacts the health of offspring.

"39339671","Influence of Comorbidity and Obesity on the Occurrence of Vascular Events in Obstructive Apnoea Treated with CPAP.","Obesity has increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is the leading risk factor for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The relationship between obesity-OSA and vascular disease seems clear. There is no consensus on whether CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) treatment prevents vascular events. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of comorbidity and obesity on the risk of vascular events in patients with OSA treated with CPAP. This study was a prospective study of historical cohorts of adult patients with OSA and CPAP. The sample was 3017 patients. Descriptive, survival (Kaplan-Meier) and Cox regression analyses were performed, calculating crude and adjusted association relationships to explain the risk of vascular events. A total of 1726 patients were obese, 782 were diabetics, and 1800 were hypertensive. The mean adherence was 6.2 (±1.8 h/day), and the mean follow-up time was 2603 days (±953.3). In the COX regression analysis, the event-related variables were baseline age (HR: 1.025: 1.012-1.037; p < 0.001), pre-treatment vascular event (HR; 2.530: 1.959-3.266; p < 0.001), hypertension (HR; 1.871: 1.187-2.672; p = 0.005) and abbreviated Charlson comorbidity index (HR; 1.289: 1.100-1.510; p = 0.002).

"39339665","Impact of Sex on the Therapeutic Efficacy of Rosiglitazone in Modulating White Adipose Tissue Function and Insulin Sensitivity.","Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are global public health issues. Although males show higher obesity and insulin resistance prevalence, current treatments often neglect sex-specific differences. White adipose tissue (WAT) is crucial in preventing lipotoxicity and inflammation and has become a key therapeutic target. Rosiglitazone (RSG), a potent PPARγ agonist, promotes healthy WAT growth and mitochondrial function through MitoNEET modulation. Recent RSG-based strategies specifically target white adipocytes, avoiding side effects. Our aim was to investigate whether sex-specific differences in the insulin-sensitizing effects of RSG exist on WAT during obesity and inflammation. We used Wistar rats of both sexes fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 22.5% fat content) for 16 weeks. Two weeks before sacrifice, a group of HFD-fed rats received RSG treatment (4 mg/kg of body weight per day) within the diet. HFD male rats showed greater insulin resistance, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dyslipidemia than females. RSG had more pronounced effects in males, significantly improving insulin sensitivity, fat storage, mitochondrial function, and lipid handling in WAT while reducing ectopic fat deposition and enhancing adiponectin signaling in the liver. Our study suggests a significant sexual dimorphism in the anti-diabetic effects of RSG on WAT, correlating with the severity of metabolic dysfunction.","Marco Bauzá-Thorbrügge, Emilia Amengual-Cladera, Bel Maria Galmés-Pascual, Andrea Morán-Costoya, Magdalena Gianotti, Adamo Valle, Ana Maria Proenza, Isabel Lladó","Nutrients","2024Sep11","Animals; Rosiglitazone; Insulin Resistance; Adipose Tissue, White; Male; Female; Rats, Wistar; Diet, High-Fat; Rats; Hypoglycemic Agents; Sex Factors; Obesity; PPAR gamma; Mitochondria; Sex Characteristics; Inflammation; Liver; Adiponectin"
"39339662","Prevalence and Risk Factors of Vitamin D Deficiency in Patients Scheduled to Undergo Revision Arthroplasty of the Hip, Knee and Shoulder-Data from a Single-Centre Analysis.","Vitamin D is crucial for ideal bone health and good muscle function, both essential requirements for successful joint arthroplasty. Hence, vitamin D deficiency has recently been identified as a predictor of poorer outcomes in patients scheduled to undergo total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Moreover, there is ample evidence today that vitamin D deficiency is associated with periprosthetic joint infection. Yet, vitamin D deficiency seems to be frequent in patients who are scheduled to undergo TJA. However, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients who require revision arthroplasty (rTJA) is largely unknown. Further, risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in these patients remain to be elucidated. For this reason, the primary objective of this study was to assess the vitamin D status of patients scheduled to undergo rTJA of the hip, knee and shoulder. The secondary objective was to identify potential risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in these patients. Serum vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels of 249 patients who were scheduled for rTJA were assessed over a period of twelve months at a high-volume TJA centre. Collectively, 23% of patients reported a routine intake of vitamin D supplements (58/249). Notably, 81% of patients (155/191) who did not report a routine vitamin D intake presented with insufficient vitamin D levels (below 30 ng/mL), while only 19% of patients (36/191) had sufficient vitamin D levels. Of those who reported a routine vitamin D intake, 75% (43/58) had sufficient vitamin D levels, while 25% (15/58) showed insufficient vitamin D status. Patients who did not routinely take any vitamin D supplements had significantly lower vitamin D levels compared to patients who reported regular vitamin D intake (19.91 ng/mL vs. 40.66 ng/mL). Further, BMI and nicotine abuse were identified as potential risk factors for hypovitaminosis D in patients without vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, the season of spring seems to be a risk factor in patients with vitamin D supplementation, while age itself did not appear to be a significant risk factor for low vitamin D levels. In conclusion, we found an alarmingly high rate of vitamin D deficiency in patients scheduled to undergo rTJA. Notably, reported routine vitamin D supplementation showed significantly increased serum vitamin D levels compared to patients with no reported supplementation. Due to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, we believe that vitamin D status should routinely be assessed in patients who are scheduled to undergo rTJA.","Konstantin Horas, Miledi Hoxha, Tizian Heinz, Axel Jakuscheit, Kilian List, Gerrit S Maier, Manuel Weißenberger, Maximilian Rudert","Nutrients","2024Sep11","Humans; Vitamin D Deficiency; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged; Prevalence; Reoperation; Vitamin D; Middle Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Dietary Supplements; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Aged, 80 and over; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Shoulder"

The research comprised two sub-studies, a pilot randomised controlled trial testing the intervention (10 intervention, n = 79 and 10 control schools, n = 58), and an investigation of the perceptions of participating educators and principals. Feasibility outcomes included reach, applicability, acceptability, implementation integrity, and a hypothesis-generating signal of effect on lifestyle factors and weight. The intervention consisted of a wellness day, weight loss manual, and text messages. Results indicated acceptable reach, with positive feedback on intervention components from principals and educators. Implementation was largely successful, though three schools dropped out due to scheduling issues. Barriers included interruption of teaching time and busy school schedules. The intervention group (n = 42) showed favourable shifts in belief patterns, stages of change, and lifestyle behaviours, with a trend towards weight loss. Control group (n = 43) changes were limited to dietary intake. The triangulation of results supported the intervention's feasibility in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. Recommendations for enhancement include adding in-person follow-up sessions and an app-based element to potentially increase impact on lifestyle indicators and weight loss.","Fatima Hoosen, Mieke Faber, Johanna H Nel, Nelia P Steyn, Marjanne Senekal","Nutrients","2024Sep11","Humans; South Africa; Feasibility Studies; Female; Male; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs; Schools; Poverty; Overweight; School Health Services; School Teachers; Pilot Projects; Adult; Pediatric Obesity; Child; Health Promotion"

We then applied network pharmacology to identify food components with potential beneficial effects on liver health and metabolic function, elucidating their action mechanisms. This review identifies and evaluates strategies for halting or reversing the development of steatotic liver disease in the early stages, as well as biomarkers that can evaluate the success or failure of such strategies. The crucial role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites for MASLD prevention and metabolic homeostasis is discussed. We also cover state-of-the-art omics approaches, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and integrated multi-omics analyses, in research on preventing MASLD. These advanced technologies provide deeper insights into physiological mechanisms and potential biomarkers for HFF development. The review concludes by proposing an integrated approach for developing HFFs targeting MASLD prevention, considering the Korean regulatory framework. We outline future research directions that bridge the gap between basic science and practical applications in health functional food development. This narrative review provides a foundation for researchers and food industry professionals interested in developing HFFs to support liver health. Emphasis is placed on maintaining metabolic balance and focusing on prevention and early-stage intervention strategies.","Heng Yuan, Eun-Soo Jung, Soo-Wan Chae, Su-Jin Jung, James W Daily, Sunmin Park","Nutrients","2024Sep11","Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Biomarkers; Functional Food; Network Pharmacology; Metabolomics; Fatty Liver; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Liver; Multiomics"
"39339657","Development of Spanish Nutrition Screening Tool for Hispanic Preschoolers.","Nutrition screening tools may facilitate early nutrition interventions specifically with Hispanic populations that are already at higher risk. There is a paucity of culturally competent and validated nutrition screening tools for 3-5-year-old Hispanic children. The purpose of this study was to develop a Spanish nutrition screening tool for 3-5-year-old children to be used by Spanish-speaking parents in community settings to appropriately address malnutrition risk factors with cultural sensitivity. All phases of the study were conducted in Spanish with native Spanish speakers. Face and content validity were established using focus groups, expert reviews, and pilot testing of the tool with Spanish-speaking parents. Parents of children 3-5 years old whose primary language was Spanish (n = 39) completed the nutrition screening, and a nutritionist completed an in-depth nutrition assessment of these children. Criterion validity was measured by comparing the results of the nutrition screening tool with the in-depth nutrition assessment. The nutrition screening tool had a sensitivity of 91.67% and a specificity of 81.48%. The negative predictive value was 69%, and the positive predictive value was 96%. The nutrition screening tool may be used to identify malnutrition in Hispanic children and needs further validation in larger samples.","Denisse Arias, Elaine Lemmon, Marc-Aurel Martial, Mariana Penaranda, Sandra Aguayo, Sarah Gunnell Bellini","Nutrients","2024Sep11","Humans; Hispanic or Latino; Child, Preschool; Female; Male; Nutrition Assessment; Mass Screening; Nutritional Status; Reproducibility of Results; Parents; Child Nutrition Disorders; Sensitivity and Specificity; Language"
"39339654","Effectiveness of DASH Diet versus Other Diet Modalities in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Metabolic syndrome refers to the coexistence of several known cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension. These conditions are interrelated and share underlying mediators, mechanisms, and pathways. Improvement in dietary habits has been shown to improve metabolic parameters in patients undergoing treatment with different diets. A systematic search in different databases was realized using the keywords ""Metabolic syndrome"", ""X syndrome"", ""Dash dietary"" and ""Dash diet"". Finally, six studies were included in this meta-analysis. All articles comparing the DASH diet vs. other diet modalities reported significant differences in favor of the DASH diet on Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -8.06, confidence interval [CI] = -9.89 to -7.32, and p < 0.00001), Diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -6.38, CI = -7.62 to -5.14, and p < 0.00001), Cholesterol HDL (SMD = 0.70, CI = 0.53 to 0.88, and p < 0.00001) and Cholesterol LDL (SMD = -1.29, CI = -1.73 to -0.85, and p < 0.00001) scales. The DASH diet has been shown to be beneficial in altered parameters in patients with MS, and the resulting improvements can significantly affect the daily health of these patients.

"39338991","HIV Modulates Osteoblast Differentiation via Upregulation of RANKL and Vitronectin.","Bone loss is a prevalent characteristic among people with HIV (PWH). We focused on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoblasts, examining their susceptibility to different HIV strains (R5- and X4-tropic) and the subsequent effects on bone tissue homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MSCs and osteoblasts are susceptible to R5- and X4-tropic HIV but do not support productive HIV replication. HIV exposure during the osteoblast differentiation process revealed that the virus could not alter mineral and organic matrix deposition. However, the reduction in runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) transcription, the increase in the transcription of nuclear receptor activator ligand kappa B (RANKL), and the augmentation of vitronectin deposition strongly suggested that X4- and R5-HIV could affect bone homeostasis. This study highlights the HIV ability to alter MSCs' differentiation into osteoblasts, critical for maintaining bone and adipose tissue homeostasis and function.","Rosa Nicole Freiberger, Cynthia Alicia Marcela López, María Belén Palma, Cintia Cevallos, Franco Agustin Sviercz, Patricio Jarmoluk, Marcela Nilda García, Jorge Quarleri, M Victoria Delpino","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep15",NA

The current prevalence of obesity in Western societies, leading to an increase in type II diabetes, and an elderly population, is also a key factor associated with the problem of wound healing. Therefore, it stands essential to find wound dressing systems that allow for reestablishing the skin integrity in the shortest possible time and with the lowest cost, avoiding further damage and promoting patients' well-being. Wounds can be classified into acute or chronic, depending essentially on the duration of the healing process, which is associated withextent and depth of the wound, localization, the level of infection, and the patient's health status. For each kind of wound and respective healing stage, there is a more suitable dressing.

"39338262","Visceral Fat Thickness, Serum Adiponectin, and Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Colorectal Adenomas.","Most cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) arise from adenomatous polyps. Identifying risk factors for colorectal adenoma (CRA) is critical for CRC prevention. Emerging evidence suggests a link between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and an elevated risk of CRA and CRC, potentially mediated by visceral obesity and adiponectin (APN). We aimed to evaluate the association between different markers of visceral obesity, serum APN, MetS, and the presence of CRA. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Clinical Center of Vojvodina, involving 120 patients, aged 40-75 years, who underwent colonoscopy between January 2022 and January 2023. Sixty patients with CRA were compared to 60 controls with normal colonoscopy findings. Visceral fat thickness (VFT) was measured using ultrasound (US), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was used to assess visceral fat area (VFA). Serum APN levels, anthropometric measures, and MetS components were also evaluated. Patients with CRA had significantly higher VFT measured by US (p < 0.05), but no significant differences were found in VFA measured by BIA, waist circumference (WC), or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). MetS was significantly more prevalent in the CRA group (55% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.05), and logistic regression confirmed MetS as a significant predictor of CRA presence (OR = 2.6). Serum APN levels were inversely correlated with visceral fat measurements and MetS (p < 0.01), but no significant difference in APN levels was observed between patients with and without CRA. This study highlights the importance of VFT measured by US and the presence of MetS as significant factors associated with CRA.","Dimitrije Damjanov, Tijana Ičin, Željka Savić, Nebojša Janjić, Stanislava Nikolić, Olgica Latinović Bošnjak, Žarko Krnetić, Vladimir Vračarić, Božidar Dejanović, Nadica Kovačević","Journal of personalized medicine","2024Sep22",NA
"39338246","Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer in South America: A Literature Review.","Background/Objectives: In 2020, ovarian cancer ranked fourth in global incidence among gynecological cancers and remains the deadliest cancer affecting women's health. Survival rates are significantly higher when the disease is detected at early stages; however, the lack of effective early detection methods underscores the importance of identifying risk factors in order to implement preventive strategies. The objective of this work is to provide an overview of the risk factors of ovarian cancer in South America, emphasizing those linked to social determinants, genetic components, and comorbidities. Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. MeSH descriptors and keywords, such as ""BRCA1 genes,"" ""BRCA2 genes"", ""Latin America"", and ""ovarian neoplasms"" were used, along with terms related to socioeconomic and health factors. Inclusion criteria focused on original studies published in the last five years involving South American women. Results: Studies were identified from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. These studies addressed genetic factors, health status at diagnosis, and sociodemographic factors, revealing important data gaps, particularly on contraception and hormone replacement therapy. The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in South America is estimated to be 15-20% among women with inherited risk factors. Social, demographic and economic factors vary by country, although commonalities include a higher prevalence among women over 50 years of age, those with limited education, and those who face barriers to accessing health care. Conclusions: Although the literature does not conclusively establish a direct link between obesity and/or diabetes and the development of ovarian cancer, the indirect association highlights the need for further clinical studies. A general research gap related to risk factors of ovarian cancer could be observed in the South American region.","Sergio Jara-Rosales, Roxana González-Stegmaier, Elena S Rotarou, Franz Villarroel-Espíndola","Journal of personalized medicine","2024Sep18",NA
"39338234","Patterns of Lipid Abnormalities in Obesity: A Comparative Analysis in Normoglycemic and Prediabetic Obese Individuals.","Background: Obesity is a growing global health concern, often accompanied by dyslipidemia, contributing to cardiovascular risk. Understanding the patterns of dyslipidemia in different glycemic states is crucial for targeted interventions. This study compares dyslipidemia patterns in normoglycemic and prediabetic obesity to improve clinical management strategies. Methods: The study analyzed the complete lipid profiles of 138 subjects, comparing the medians, prevalence, diagnostic performance, and risk assessment of each lipid parameter across 54 non-obese (NO), 44 normoglycemic obese (NG-OB), and 40 pre-diabetic obese (PreDM-OB) groups. Results: Elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were the most prevalent forms of dyslipidemia observed in obesity (45.35% and 43.53%, respectively). Stratification by glycemic status revealed that triglyceride (TG) levels were elevated in both the NG-OB and PreDM-OB groups, with a more marked increase in the latter group (73.07 mg/dL vs. 97.87 mg/dL vs. 121.8 mg/dL, respectively). Elevated LDL showed better diagnostic performance and higher odds ratios (OR) in the NG-OB group (AUC = 0.660, p = 0.006; OR = 2.78, p = 0.022). Conversely, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was more common and exhibited significant diagnostic performance, with higher OR values in the PreDM-OB group (AUC = 0.687, p = 0.002; OR = 3.69, p = 0.018). Importantly, all lipid ratios were elevated in obesity, with TC/HDL showing the highest predictive ability for prediabetes (AUC = 0.7491, p < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings revealed unique and common lipid abnormalities in normoglycemic and prediabetic obesity. Future research should explore the effects of targeted lipid management on obesity-associated complications.","Yazeed Alshuweishi, Abdulmalik A Almufarrih, Arwa Abudawood, Dalal Alfayez, Abdullah Y Alkhowaiter, Hamood AlSudais, Abdulaziz M Almuqrin","Journal of personalized medicine","2024Sep15",NA
"39338213","Lifestyle Factors, Sociodemographic Characteristics and Incident Hypertension: A Prospective Analysis of the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort.","Hypertension is a significant chronic disease globally, and lifestyle modifications are crucial for the prevention of this disease. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the associations between lifestyle factors and the incidence of hypertension, stratified by sociodemographic characteristics. We analyzed 113,022 adults (65,315 men), aged 20 years or older from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort 2.0 who participated in health screening between 2002 and 2003. Lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking, physical activity) were assessed at baseline using self reports, and incident hypertension was defined based on physician diagnoses. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations. During an 11.6-year follow-up, 26,812 new cases of hypertension were identified. The risk of hypertension was high among men and women who smoked over 20 cigarettes daily (men: hazard ratio [HR]: 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.21; women: HR: 1.62; 95% CI 1.17-2.25) and those who drank over 1.5 bottles of alcohol daily (men, HR: 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.24; women, HR: 1.23; 95% CI 1.02-1.47). These associations tended to be high in high-income men (HR: 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14), low-income women (HR: 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35) and non-obese women (HR: 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) who currently smoked. Physical activity was inversely associated with incident hypertension in men (HR: 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99). Unhealthy lifestyle factors, such as heavy smoking and drinking, was associated with an increased risk of hypertension, with variations by income, BMI, and sex. These findings underscore the importance of tailored, population-specific prevention strategies to address hypertension disparities.","Jung-Eun Lee, Anthony Kityo, Sang-Ah Lee","Journal of personalized medicine","2024Sep09",NA
"39338158","Sex Differences in Biochemical Analyses, Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Their Correlation with CRP in Healthy Mexican Individuals.","Few studies have been undertaken to detect the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in healthy populations (individuals auto-reported as healthy). These risk factors include high body mass index (BMI), high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), high systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), high uric acid and high Castelli's risk index (CRI); this last is the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (TC/HDL-c). In addition, the correlations between CRFs and the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP) has not been explored in each sex. Therefore, this study aimed to determine sex differences in the abnormalities in blood and urine analyses, including CRFs and their correlation with CPR in a non-representative sample of healthy Mexican individuals. A total of 238 subjects were included, 123 (51.7%) of whom were women. The main blood alterations detected were high serum lipids, including high total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and the CRI, which were higher in men than in women. The men's samples had a higher frequency of hypertensives and pre-hypertensives than the women's sample. The CRP showed positive significant correlations with the CRFs: BMI, WHR, SBP, DBP, uric acid, and the CRI, with a higher correlation for BMI and WHR, and most of these correlations were higher in women than in men. Additionally, all these factors showed a positive correlation among them. In conclusion, the main alterations observed in blood are related to cardiovascular risk and were reported with a higher frequency in men when compared with women. This finding can be related to the higher values of WHR in this sex; additionally, the inflammatory marker CRP was more correlated with the cardiometabolic risk factors in women than in men, which suggests a different relationship between inflammation and cardiometabolic risk factors in each sex.","Aniel Jessica Leticia Brambila-Tapia, Alejandra Soledad González-Gómez, Laura Arely Carrillo-Delgadillo, Ana Míriam Saldaña-Cruz, Ingrid Patricia Dávalos-Rodríguez","Journal of personalized medicine","2024Aug26",NA
"39338133","Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Associated with Impoverishment Due to Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditure in São Paulo City, Brazil.","The rise in obesity and related chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) during recent decades in Brazil has been associated with increases in the financial burden and risk of impoverishment due to out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure. Thus, this study investigated trends and predictors associated with impoverishment due to health expenditure, in the population of São Paulo city, Brazil, between 2003 and 2015. Household data from the São Paulo Health Survey (n = 5475) were used to estimate impoverishment linked to OOP health expenses, using the three thresholds of International Poverty Lines (IPLs) defined by the World Bank at 1.90, 3.20, and 5.50 dollars per capita per day purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2011. The results indicated a high incidence of impoverishment due to OOP disbursements for health care throughout the period, predominantly concentrated among low-income individuals. Lifestyle choices referring to leisure-time physical activity (OR = 0.766 at $3.20 IPL, and OR = 0.789 at $5.50 IPL) were linked to reduction in the risk for impoverishment due to OOP health expenditures whilst there were increases in the probability of impoverishment due to cardiometabolic risk factors referring to obesity (OR = 1.588 at $3.20 IPL, and OR = 1.633 at $5.50 IPL), and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (OR = 2.268 at $1.90 IPL, OR = 1.967 at $3.20 IPL, and OR = 1.936 at $5.50 IPL). Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with an increase in the probability of impoverishment at only the $1.90 IPL (OR = 2.506), whilst coefficients for high blood pressure presented lack of significance in the models. Health policies should focus on interventions for prevention of obesity to ensure the financial protection of the population in São Paulo city, Brazil, especially targeting modifiable lifestyle choices like promotion of physical activity and reduction of tobacco use.","Lucas Akio Iza Trindade, Jaqueline Lopes Pereira, Jean Michel Rocha Sampaio Leite, Marcelo Macedo Rogero, Regina Mara Fisberg, Flavia Mori Sarti","International journal of environmental research and public health","2024Sep21","Humans; Brazil; Health Expenditures; Adult; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Life Style; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Young Adult; Poverty; Adolescent; Aged; Risk Factors; Obesity"
"39338122","Cardiorespiratory Fitness Is Not Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Firefighters: A Cross-Sectional Study in South African Firefighters.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are frequently reported among firefighters, yet no studies have compared these factors between male and female firefighters, specifically from a low- to middle-income country (LMIC). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of CVD risk factors and their relationship with cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) in 254 active career firefighters (mean age: 42.6 ± 7.8 years). The assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and VO2max. The results indicated that 48.0% and 51.8% of females and males were pre-hypertensive, respectively. Hypertension was identified in 15.8% of the firefighters. According to body mass index (BMI), 37.3% of males and 25% of females were found to be overweight, while an additional 44.9% of males and 45.7% of females were classified as obese. Only 17.3% of males and 18.2% of females were found to be of normal weight. These findings were corroborated by categories of central obesity using waist circumference (WC), which were 47.7% for males and 41.6% for females. Low HDL-C was found in 95.2% of males and 86.4% of females, with 28.3% of males also having elevated triglyceride levels (TG). VO2max was ""excellent"" in 48.8% of males and 12.6% of females, though it had no significant association with most CVD risk factors. The only notable link was a small correlation between VO2max and triglycerides (r = -0.215; p = 0.001). These findings suggest that while cardiorespiratory fitness may have no impact, additional factors likely contribute to the cardiovascular health of firefighters, necessitating the need for comprehensive health and fitness programmes.","Tebogo Jenniffer Moselakgomo, Takalani Clearance Muluvhu, Merling Phaswana, Ina Shaw, Brandon S Shaw","International journal of environmental research and public health","2024Sep19","Humans; Male; Female; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Firefighters; Middle Aged; South Africa; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Body Mass Index; Heart Disease Risk Factors"

Prior research has established an association between personality traits, body mass index, and health-related behaviors. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of personality trait assessments in identifying individuals at risk of glycemic dysregulation and increasing BMI. This cross-sectional study used a dataset comprising 140 participants with diabetes who completed the Big Five personality trait questionnaire from the Lolland-Falster Health Study. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between personality traits, glycemic control, and BMI ≥ 25. No significant associations between personality traits and glycemic control were found. There was a significant association between agreeableness and lower odds of BMI ≥ 25 in the unadjusted analysis (OR 0.54 (0.34-0.86)), which persisted after adjusting for sex, age, and education (OR 0.54 (0.33-0.89)). No significant association between glycemic control and personality traits was observed in this small sample study. However, higher levels of agreeableness were associated with a lower likelihood of having a BMI of ≥25. This preliminary study suggests that integrating personality assessments could help identify individuals at risk of increasing BMI. These findings highlight the potential of using personality traits to guide targeted interventions, offering a direction for future research.","Zandra Overgaard Pedersen, Bettina Ewers, Cathrine Lawaetz Wimmelmann, Allan Kofoed-Enevoldsen, Rasmus Køster-Rasmussen, Christian Couppé, Erik Simonsen, Jesper Dammeyer","International journal of environmental research and public health","2024Sep18","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Personality; Denmark; Glycemic Control; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Adult"
"39338070","The Influence of the Home Food Environment on the Eating Behaviors, Family Meals, and Academic Achievement of Adolescents in Schools in the UAE.","The eating behavior (EB) and habits developed during adolescence tend to persist into adulthood, with parents and caregivers playing a significant role in shaping their children's food choices. The home environment is a crucial setting for developing eating behavior during adolescence. This study aimed to explore the influence of the home food environment (HFE) and its correlates on EB, family meals (FMs), and academic achievement among adolescents in schools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 304 school-aged adolescents from the UAE. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, dietary habits, information related to the HFE (food availability and accessibility), physical activity, sleep patterns, and academic achievement. Several questionnaire items were combined to create an HFE score. These questions included the frequency of weekly family meals, meal preparation practices, and accessibility to healthy and unhealthy food products and snacks at home. The HFE score was dichotomized into favorable and unfavorable HFE scores. Similarly, EB and FM scores were generated by combining responses to various related questions. The participants' weights and heights were measured. The findings reported that more than half (55%) of the adolescents were either overweight or obese. The majority of the participants had favorable HFE (57.2%), EB (69.1%), and FM scores (58.2%). The significant correlates to the HFE were as follows: male participants whose parents attended college (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.15-0.62; p < 0.001), high academic achievers (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.02-3.82; p = 0.043), and those who were physically active (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.14-2.85; p = 0.012), were more likely to have favorable HFE. Moreover, the HFE score showed a highly significant positive correlation with the EB score (r = 0.573, p < 0.001) and the FM score (r = 0.384, p < 0.001). These results underscore the critical role of a healthy HFE in shaping healthy positive eating behaviors and food choices among adolescents.

The prevalence rates of mild and severe periodontitis were 18.1% and 7.5%, respectively. Patients with periodontitis were older, current smokers, had a lower family income, were less likely to engage in regular tooth brushing or exercise, and had a higher body mass index and glucose levels. Periodontitis was more prevalent in the MANW and MAO groups than in the MHNW and MHO groups. Compared with the MHNW phenotype, the MAO and MANW phenotypes were significantly associated with mild and severe periodontitis, and the MHO phenotype was significantly associated with mild periodontitis. The MANW and MAO phenotypes are independent risk factors for periodontitis in adults without diagnosed chronic diseases. To enhance public health, a greater focus and effective approaches for identifying metabolic disease phenotypes among individuals with periodontal disease may be clinically relevant.","Young Sang Lyu, Youngmin Yoon, Jin Hwa Kim, Sang Yong Kim","International journal of environmental research and public health","2024Sep04","Humans; Republic of Korea; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Nutrition Surveys; Periodontitis; Phenotype; Body Size; Metabolic Syndrome; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Aged; Body Mass Index; Obesity; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Young Adult"
"39338049","Age and Hair Cortisol Levels as Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.","Chronic psychosocial stress is known to adversely impact immune function. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, occupational stress among workers in healthcare was at an unprecedented level due to risks of infection and work demands. We performed a nested case-control study to investigate the associations between chronic stress and the risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2. We collected 3 cm of hair from employees at an academic medical center who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 49) and controls who tested negative (N = 49), matched for age, race, and sex. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was based on polymerase chain reaction or antibody tests. As a proxy for chronic stress, we segmented hair into 1 cm sections each representing one month and measured cortisol levels using a cortisol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For cases, we used cortisol concentrations measured in hair segments from the month prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and for controls, we used time-matched hair segments. We fitted conditional logistic regression models adjusted for sex, age, race, body mass index, and healthcare worker status, and stratified models by older vs. younger age (cutoff = 41 years). African Americans had higher hair cortisol levels relative to participants of other races and ethnicities. In adjusted models, higher hair cortisol concentrations were associated with an increased odds of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.84; CI: 1.10-3.07) among older, but not younger, participants. The results suggest that psychosocial stress may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection; stress management may be an important part of a comprehensive approach to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nancy Fiedler, Pamela Ohman-Strickland, Jialin Doris Shen, Kathleen Black, Daniel B Horton, Reynold Panettieri, Martin J Blaser, Jeffrey Carson, Kestutis Bendinskas, Hana Cheng, Emily S Barrett","International journal of environmental research and public health","2024Sep02","Humans; COVID-19; Hydrocortisone; Hair; Male; Female; Case-Control Studies; Adult; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Age Factors; Stress, Psychological; Risk Factors"

This study was conducted using a pre-validated questionnaire at two medical colleges in the UAE and Oman. The first study (UAE) results are already published. Here, we present the findings of the second study (Oman) and compare them. The prevalence of PCOS was 4.6% (n = 7) in Oman and 27.6% (n = 69) in the UAE using the NIH criteria. The most common symptoms were irregular periods, acne, and thinning of hair. Students showed acne as the most prevalent symptom of clinical hyperandrogenism. Omani students showed significantly more acne [70.1% (n = 108) vs. 41.6% (n = 104)], while Emirati students showed a higher prevalence of hirsutism [32% (n = 80) vs. 23.3% (n = 36)]. A higher number of students had irregular periods 30.8% (77/150) in the UAE, although the difference was not statistically significant. The prevalence of PCOS was significantly higher in Emirati medical students than in Omani students (p < 0.05). The prevalence was also lower among medical students in Oman compared to an unselected population, reported by a study that included all consecutive women between 12 and 45 years of age attending a hospital.

Some inflammatory and cardioembolic indexes derived from routine laboratory tests have captivated the attention of the medical community. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether these markers are effective in distinguishing varying degrees of obesity and MetS in children and adolescents. We conducted a retrospective study. A total of 71 children and adolescents, aged between 6 and 16, were included in the study. Among them, 5 were overweight, 35 had obesity, and 31 had severe obesity. According to the NCEP ATP III criteria, 32 individuals had Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), while 39 did not have MetS. The MetS positive group had higher values of TG/HDL-C (p < 0.001), TC/HDL-C (p < 0.001), MHR (p = 0.015), LHR (p = 0.001), NHR (p = 0.001), atherogenic index of plasma (p < 0.001), and PHR (p < 0.001). ESR, NLR, PLR, and SII did not progressively increase with the number of MetS criteria. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that markers such as TG/HDL-C, the atherogenic index of plasma, TC/HDL-C, LHR, NHR, and PHR were effective in identifying MetS in children and adolescents with obesity.

"39337979","Biomarkers and Data Visualization of Insulin Resistance and Metabolic Syndrome: An Applicable Approach.","Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and insulin resistance (IR) are widespread yet often undetected in their early stages, contributing to a silent epidemic. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is also highly prevalent, increasing the chronic disease burden. Annual check-ups are inadequate for early detection due to conventional result formats that lack specific markers and comprehensive visualization. The aim of this study was to evaluate low-budget biochemical and hematological parameters, with data visualization, for identifying IR and MetS in a community-based laboratory. In a cross-sectional study with 1870 participants in Patras, Greece, blood samples were analyzed for key cardiovascular and inflammatory markers. IR diagnostic markers (TyG-Index, TyG-BMI, Triglycerides/HDL ratio, NLR) were compared with HOMA-IR. Innovative data visualization techniques were used to present metabolic profiles. Notable differences in parameters of cardiovascular risk and inflammation were observed between normal-weight and obese people, highlighting BMI as a significant risk factor. Also, the inflammation marker NHR (Neutrophils to HDL-Cholesterol Ratio) Index was successful at distinguishing the obese individuals and those with MetS from normal individuals. Additionally, a new diagnostic index of IR, combining BMI (Body Mass Index) and NHR Index, demonstrated better performance than other well-known indices. Lastly, data visualization significantly helped individuals understand their metabolic health patterns more clearly. BMI and NHR Index could play an essential role in assessing metabolic health patterns. Integrating specific markers and data visualization in routine check-ups enhances the early detection of IR and MetS, aiding in better patient awareness and adherence.","Christos Sotiropoulos, Nikolaos Giormezis, Vayianos Pertsas, Theodoros Tsirkas","Life (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep21",NA

However, there is a lack on studies investigating if DO exhibits higher cardiometabolic risk than non-dynapenic obesity. Objectives: To assess if individuals with DO exhibit elevated cardiometabolic risk compared to non-dynapenic obesity. Methods: a cross-sectional study that analyzed the data of workers from a quaternary care hospital collected between November 2018 and March 2020. Participants were stratified into the following anthropometrical and peripheral muscle strength profiles: non-obese/non-dynapenic (NOND), non-obese/dynapenic (NOD), obese/non-dynapenic (OND), and obese dynapenic (OD). Cardiovascular risk was evaluated by Atherogenic Index (AI), Plasma Atherogenic Index (PAI), Hypertriglyceridemic Waist (HW), A Body Shape Index (ABSI), Atherogenic Dyslipidemia (AD), Castelli Indices I and II, and Framingham Score (FS). Results: the OD group had significantly lower HDL compared to all others (p = 0.009), and despite exhibited lower prevalence of HW compared to OND (p < 0.01), a higher cardiometabolic risk compared to OND profile was observed assessing AI (p = 0.05), Castelli I (p < 0.05) and Castelli II (p < 0.05) scores.

One hundred eighty-one adults (90 females and 91 males) were qualified for inclusion in the experimental group. All participants had a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 25 kg/m2 (98 patients with obesity and 83 with overweight). The mean BMI in the obesity group was 33.6 kg/m2, and all participants had class 1 obesity. The control group comprised 69 individuals (56 females and 13 males) with normal BMI. The basic measurements were performed, and the participants filled out questionnaires describing their health conditions and lifestyles. Each participant underwent an electrocardiographic (ECG) examination and a 24 h Holter ECG examination. In patients with class 1 obesity compared to the control patients, the average numbers of premature ventricular beats (PVBs) and premature supraventricular beats (SPBs) were statistically significantly higher (p = 0.030 and p = 0.042).

"39337892","Advantages of Robotic Surgery for Patients of Reproductive Age with Endometrial Cancer.","This review presents current knowledge on the surgical treatment of endometrial cancer in young patients. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in Europe. Higher morbidity is correlated with obesity, hypertension and diabetes, which are growing worldwide. However, endometrial cancer at an early age is very rare. The first line of treatment for this cancer is radical hysterectomy, which is controversial in young women. There is an alternative method of fertility-sparing treatment. However, there is a group of young patients for whom surgical treatment is recommended. According to European guidelines, minimally invasive surgery is recommended for endometrial cancer. The aim of the study was to present the advantages of robotic surgery for endometrial cancer detected at a young age. The procedure of radical treatment with robot-assisted laparoscopy is more precise. Better visualization and stabilization of instruments allow a shorter procedure time, a brief hospital stay and fewer complications. Quality of life may be at a similar level. Incisions after trocars are painless and more esthetic than a classical wound. Bilateral adnexectomy in endometrial cancer depends on age, molecular status of the cancer, stage, genetic risk factors and individual decision.

Additional risk factors for these thrombotic traits may be concurrent (known or unknown) malignancies, including at hepatic level. Among these, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a rare cancer of intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts, represents a very aggressive condition that typically associates local and distant advanced stages on first presentation requiring a prompt diagnosis and a stratified management. This neoplasia has been reported to present a large spectrum of paraneoplastic syndromes in terms of dermatologic, renal, systemic, neurologic, endocrine, and cardiovascular settings, that, overall, are exceptional in their epidemiologic impact when compared to other cancers. Our aim was to introduce a most unusual case of CCA-associated distant thrombosis in a male adult who initially was considered to experience COVID-19-related thrombotic features while having a history of obesity and bariatric surgery. This is a hybrid type of paper: this clinical vignette is accompanied by two distinct sample-focused analyses as a basis for discussion; they each had different methods depending on their current level of statistical evidence. We only included English-published articles in PubMed, as follows: Firstly, we conducted a search of reports similar to the present case, regarding distant vein thrombosis in CCA, from inception until the present time. We performed a literature search using the keywords ""cholangiocarcinoma"", ""thrombosis"", and ""Trousseau's syndrome"" and identified 20 cases across 19 original papers; hence, the current level of evidence remains very low Secondly, we searched for the highest level of statistical evidence concerning the diagnosis of venous thrombosis/thromboembolism in patients who underwent COVID-19 infection (key search terms were ""COVID-19"", alternatively, ""coronavirus"", and ""SARS-CoV-2"", and ""thrombosis"", alternatively, ""thromboembolism"") and included the most recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses that were published in 2024 (from 1 January 2024 until 8 July 2024).

These deficits determine an impairment of personal, social, scholastic, or occupational functioning. Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by an increased incidence and a multifactorial etiology, including genetic and environmental components. Data largely explain the role of genetic and environmental factors, also through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and miRNA. Despite genetic factors, nutritional factors also play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these disorders, both in the prenatal and postnatal period, underscoring that the control of modifiable factors could decrease the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders. The preventive role of nutrition is widely studied as regards many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, but actually we also know the effects of nutrition on embryonic brain development and the influence of prenatal and preconceptional nutrition in predisposition to various pathologies. These factors are not limited only to a correct caloric intake and a good BMI, but rather to an adequate and balanced intake of macro and micronutrients, the type of diet, and other elements such as exposure to heavy metals. This review represents an analysis of the literature as regards the physiopathological mechanisms by which food influences our state of health, especially in the age of development (from birth to adolescence), through prenatal and preconceptional changes, underlying how controlling these nutritional factors should improve mothers' nutritional state to significantly reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. We searched key words such as ""maternal nutrition and neurodevelopmental disorders"" on Pubmed and Google Scholar, selecting the main reviews and excluding individual cases. Therefore, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics teach us the importance of personalized nutrition for good health.

The identification of novel risk factors contributing to CVD onset and progression has enabled an improved understanding of CVD pathophysiology. In addition to the conventional risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and smoking, the role of gut microbiome and intestinal microbe-derived metabolites in maintaining cardiovascular health has gained recent attention in the field of CVD pathophysiology. The human gastrointestinal tract caters to a highly diverse spectrum of microbes recognized as the gut microbiota, which are central to several physiologically significant cascades such as metabolism, nutrient absorption, and energy balance. The manipulation of the gut microbial subtleties potentially contributes to CVD, inflammation, neurodegeneration, obesity, and diabetic onset. The existing paradigm of studies suggests that the disruption of the gut microbial dynamics contributes towards CVD incidence. However, the exact mechanistic understanding of such a correlation from a signaling perspective remains elusive. This review has focused upon an in-depth characterization of gut microbial metabolites and their role in varied pathophysiological conditions, and highlights the potential molecular and signaling mechanisms governing the gut microbial metabolites in CVDs. In addition, it summarizes the existing courses of therapy in modulating the gut microbiome and its metabolites, limitations and scientific gaps in our current understanding, as well as future directions of studies involving the modulation of the gut microbiome and its metabolites, which can be undertaken to develop CVD-associated treatment options.

This study aimed to assess the clinical utility of an 8-SNP LDLC polygenic score in a central Romanian cohort. The cohort included 97 healthy controls and 125 patients with premature (P)CHD. The weighted LDLC polygenic risk score (wPRS) was analyzed for associations with relevant phenotypic traits, PCHD risk, and clinical FH diagnosis. The wPRS positively correlated with LDLC and DLCN scores, and LDLC concentrations could be predicted by wPRS. A trend of increasing LDLC and DLCN scores with wPRS deciles was observed. A +1 SD increase in wPRS was associated with a 36% higher likelihood of having LDLC > 190 mg/dL and increases in LDLC (+0.20 SD), DLCN score (+0.16 SD), and BMI (+0.15 SD), as well as a decrease in HDLC (-0.14 SD). Although wPRS did not predict PCHD across the entire spectrum of values, individuals above the 90th percentile were three times more likely to have PCHD compared to those within the 10th or 20th percentiles. Additionally, wPRS > 45th percentile identified ""definite"" clinical FH (DLCN score > 8) with 100% sensitivity and 45% specificity.

"39337444","The Link between Salivary Amylase Activity, Overweight, and Glucose Homeostasis.","Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon, plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic health, particularly by enhancing insulin sensitivity. Given the rising incidence of metabolic disorders, understanding the factors that influence butyrate production is of significant interest. This study explores the link between salivary amylase activity and butyrate levels in overweight women of reproductive age. Participants were categorized into low (LSA) and high (HSA) salivary amylase activity groups and further divided into two subgroups: one followed a low-starch diet (LS), and the other underwent caloric restriction (CR). We assessed salivary amylase activity and measured serum butyrate concentrations to examine their associations. Our findings showed a significant, though weak, positive correlation (ρ = 0.0486, p < 0.05), suggesting a link between salivary amylase activity and butyrate levels. The statistical significance, despite the weak correlation, implies that this relationship is not random. Moreover, higher baseline butyrate levels were observed in women with elevated salivary amylase activity. Also, women with low salivary amylase activity on a low-starch diet experienced a more pronounced increase in butyrate levels compared to those on caloric restriction. These results suggest that salivary amylase activity and dietary intake interact to influence butyrate production, with potential implications for improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. The study underscores the potential of butyrate in enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting overall metabolic well-being. Further research is necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved and to understand the long-term effects of butyrate on metabolic health across different populations.","Gita Erta, Gita Gersone, Antra Jurka, Pēteris Tretjakovs","International journal of molecular sciences","2024Sep15","Humans; Female; Adult; Overweight; Saliva; Homeostasis; Amylases; Caloric Restriction; Glucose; Butyrates; Insulin Resistance"

The concentrations of chromogranin A, serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were determined in the study group. Characteristics of the study group and of the controls were defined by age, sex and BMI, and the effects of these factors on the ghrelin and leptin concentrations were assessed. The data obtained were subject to statistical analysis. The study cohort showed higher levels of ghrelin as compared to the controls (142.31 ± 26.00 vs. 121.49 ± 35.45, p = 0.016), and no statistical difference in the levels of leptin (11.15 ± 9.6 vs. 12.94 ± 20.30, p = 0.439) were observed. Significantly lower levels of leptin were found in patients with the small intestine primary location, as compared to individuals with primary locations in the lungs and the pancreas (4.9 ± 6.49 vs. 16.97 ± 15.76, p = 0.045, and 4.9 ± 6.49 vs. 12.89 ± 8.56, p = 0.016, respectively). A positive correlation was observed between the leptin levels and the BMIs in both the study group (rS = 0.33, p = 0.016) and the controls (rS = 0.41, p = 0.001). The study group showed a negative correlation between the leptin levels and 5-HIAA (rS = -0.32, p = 0.026) and a negative correlation between the leptin levels and Ki-67 (rS = -0.33, p = 0.018). The control group showed negative correlations between the ghrelin and the volunteer age (rS = -0.41, p = 0.008), the leptin and the volunteer age (rS = -0.44, p < 0.001), the leptin and total cholesterol (rS = -0.24, p < 0.049) as well as the leptin and triglycerides (rS = -0.33, p < 0.006). The current study emphasized the importance of the markers' determination, where ghrelin appears as a valuable diagnostic biomarker in NETs, probably responsible for maintaining a normal BMI, despite the progression of the disease.","Janusz Strzelczyk, Agnes Bocian-Jastrzębska, Joanna Katarzyna Strzelczyk, Monika Wójcik-Giertuga, Krzysztof Biernacki, Dariusz Kajdaniuk, Beata Kos-Kudła","International journal of molecular sciences","2024Sep11","Humans; Ghrelin; Leptin; Female; Male; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Middle Aged; Adult; Body Mass Index; Aged; Stomach Neoplasms; Adipokines; Case-Control Studies; Biomarkers, Tumor; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Cachexia; Intestinal Neoplasms"
"39337223","The Mediating Roles of Lung Function Traits and Inflammatory Factors on the Associations between Measures of Obesity and Risk of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","Identifying mediators between obesity-related traits and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) would inform preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce the burden of LRITs. We aimed to recognize whether lung function and inflammatory factors mediate their associations. We conducted a two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Two-sample MR was performed on (1) obesity-related traits (i.e., body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]) and LRTIs (i.e., acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, influenza, and pneumonia), (2) obesity-related traits and potential mediators, and (3) potential mediators and LRTIs. Next, two-step MR was applied to infer whether the mediation effects exist. We found that C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) mediated 32.59% (95% CI: 17.90%, 47.27%), 7.96% (95% CI: 1.79%, 14.14%), and 4.04% (95% CI: 0.34%, 7.74%) of the effect of BMI on pneumonia, and they mediated 26.90% (95% CI: 13.98%, 39.83%), 10.23% (95% CI: 2.72%, 17.73%), and 4.67% (95% CI: 0.25%, 9.09%) of the effect of WC on pneumonia, respectively. Additionally, CRP, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1 mediated 18.66% (95% CI: 8.70%, 28.62%), 8.72% (95% CI: 1.86%, 15.58%), and 8.41% (95% CI: 2.77%, 14.06%) of the effect of BMI on acute bronchitis, and they mediated 19.96% (95% CI: 7.44%, 32.48%), 12.19% (95% CI: 2.00%, 22.39%), and 12.61% (95% CI: 2.94%, 22.29%) of the effect of WC on acute bronchitis, respectively.

"39337202","A Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Relationship between Work-Related, Lifestyle Factors and Non-Specific Neck and Shoulder Pain in a Southeast Asian Population.","Non-specific neck and shoulder pain (NSNSP) is prevalent among working adults. The increased use of electronic devices and prevalence of remote working and study following the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns about the potential rise in such conditions. This study aims to investigate the associations between work-related, lifestyle factors and NSNSP in the adult Southeast Asian Singaporean population. An online survey was administered electronically to Singaporeans aged 21 and above. Demographic data, NSNSP prevalence, computer and smartphone usage durations, sleep patterns, and exercise frequency were captured after obtaining informed consent (SIT institutional review board approval #2023014). A total of 302 validated responses were recorded, including 212 suffering from NSNSP versus 90 in the comparison group. The NSNSP group showed significantly longer smartphone usage (5.37 ± 3.50 h/day) compared to the comparison group (4.46 ± 3.36 h/day, p = 0.04). Furthermore, the NSNSP group had lower exercise frequency (2.10 ± 1.74 days/week vs. 2.93 ± 2.21 days/week, p < 0.01) and shorter weekly exercise duration (2.69 ± 3.05 h/week vs. 4.11 ± 4.15 h/week, p < 0.01). The average NSNSP severity in this group was 34.9 ± 19.96 out of 100, correlating significantly with age (r = 0.201, p < 0.01) and BMI (r = 0.27, p < 0.01). This preliminary cross-sectional study examines characteristics of adult Southeast Asians with NSNSP post-COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate significantly longer smartphone use and less exercise in NSNSP respondents, with both age and body mass index (BMI) demonstrating significant correlations with NSNSP severity.","Chi Ngai Lo, Victoria Yu En Teo, Nur Farah Ain Binte Abdul Manaff, Tessa Chu-Yu Seow, Karthik Subramhanya Harve, Bernard Pui Lam Leung","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep15",NA
"39337197","Influence of Physical Activity, Physical Fitness, Age, Biological Maturity and Anthropometric Variables on the Probability of Suffering Lumbar, Neck and Shoulder Pain in Spanish Adolescents from the Region of Murcia.","Background: Back pain in adolescents is a common injury, mainly affecting the lumbar, cervical and sometimes shoulder region. This has been related to various factors, such as lifestyle habits or physical capacity, but no previous research has shown conclusive results. The aims of this study was to analyze the risk of suffering lumbar, neck and shoulder pain according to anthropometric and physical fitness variables, physical activity level, age and biological maturity in adolescents, as well as the influence of sex in the study results. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed, including a sample of 2015 adolescents (boys: n = 1006, mean age = 14.41 ± 1.35 years-old; girls: n = 1009, mean age = 14.48 ± 1.41 years-old). The participants underwent an anthropometric evaluation and physical fitness tests were carried out, including a 20 m shuttle run, a counter movement jump, a horizontal jump, a 20 m sprint and push-up tests, followed by the completion of lumbar, neck and shoulder pain questionnaires. Results: Higher values in age and peak height velocity (PHV) showed an increase in the risk of suffering lumbar, neck and shoulder pain (OR = 0.79-1.55; p = 0.000-0.025). The anthropometric variables related to adiposity showed an increase in the risk of suffering back pain, with significant incidence in the lumbar region (OR = 1.32-1.60; p = 0.000); while muscle mass showed a protective effect (OR = 0.59; p = 0.000). Regarding the fitness tests, a better physical fitness seemed to protect adolescents from suffering from the analyzed back pains in the general sample and in the boys sample (OR = 0.56-1.60; p = 0.000), while in the girls sample the influence of the physical fitness was less relevant. Conclusions: Both anthropometry and physical fitness may influence the occurrence of back pain in adolescents, with some variations in their importance according to sex.","Mario Albaladejo-Saura, Adrián Mateo-Orcajada, Lucía Abenza-Cano, Raquel Vaquero-Cristóbal","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep15",NA

An effective weight management strategy is hard to design due to insufficient evidence. This work was initiated to study race, ethnicity, and geography as determinants of excessive weight and low physical activity in the pediatric population. To achieve this aim, we systematically review publications on daily length of physical activity of light, moderate, and vigorous intensity, as well as sedentary time and BMI and its dynamics in children of different races/ethnicities and geographies. The extracted data are stratified into six major geographic regions and six races/ethnicities. Then, a random-effects meta-analysis is used to calculate the pooled mean of each outcome measure. A ridge regression is constructed to explore age-related change in BMI. A Kruskal-Wallis H test is applied to compare the pooled duration of physical activity and sedentary time in the subgroups. Finally, we calculate paired correlation coefficients between BMI and physical activity/inactivity for each group. The findings can be further used in public health surveillance to clarify the epidemiology of obesity, to guide priority setting and planning, and to develop and evaluate public health policy and strategy.","Yauhen Statsenko, Darya Smetanina, Gillian Lylian Simiyu, Maroua Belghali, Nadirah Ghenimi, Guido Hein Huib Mannaerts, Leena Almaramah, Maryam Alhashmi, Nazia Chun Mohammad, Rahaf Al Hamed, Sara F Alblooshi, Khawla Talbi, Maitha Albreiki, Fatima Alkaabi, Anna Ponomareva, Milos Ljubisavljevic","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep13",NA

This study aimed to investigate Hong Kong young adults' physical activity, related behaviors, and perceptions of body image during the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey of young adults aged 18-29 was conducted from February to March 2021 using the well-validated Multidimensional Body Self-Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ). Among 408 respondents, 52.5% had a normal weight in the BMI range, 45.1% engaged in ≥8 h of sedentary behavior daily, 77.2% engaged in no regular or inadequate physical activity (<2.5 h/week), and only 22.3% joined a fitness club. BMI, regular physical activity, and joining any fitness club/class were significantly associated with the most factors or additional subscales. A multiple linear regression model showed that the underweight respondents (reference group: normal) (β = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.12) were less likely to have high scores of fitness orientation. The respondents who engaged in regular physical activity <2.5 h/week (β = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.54), engaged in regular physical activity ≥2.5 h/week (β = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.14) (reference group: no regular physical activity), and joined a fitness club/class (β = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.45) were more likely to have a high score of fitness orientation.

This study sought to document how the systemic biomarkers of inflammation varied based on food choices among patients with T2DM. This cross-sectional study enrolled ambulatory patients with T2DM. Demographic and clinical information was collected. Five drops of fingerstick blood were collected using an absorbent paper device (HemaSpot HFR). C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A protein (SAA), and fibrinogen were measured using a Luminex assay. Patient-generated 7-day food diaries were analyzed using a validated food processor software. Data were analyzed by Pearson's correlation tests, linear regression and logistic regression with the significance level set at 0.05. Among the 71 participants, 43 (60.6%) were females. The average age and duration of T2DM were 64.1 ± 10.3 and 15.8 ± 9.1 years, respectively. In a simple linear regression run with selected micronutrients, iron [F (1, 53) = 5.319, p < 0.05, adj. R2 = 0.074] significantly predicted plasma CRP. This significance was lost with multiple linear regressions including age, gender, BMI, T2DM duration, T2DM complications, glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other micronutrients. The average intake of most micronutrients by the participants was below the recommended daily intake. A higher intake of iron-rich foods was associated with higher levels of systemic inflammation in a simple linear regression model, but the association was not present after adjusting for patient factors like age, gender, BMI and T2DM-related variables. This relationship needs to be explored further given the key role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its associated complications.","Kenneth Izuora, Amalie Alver, Arpita Basu, Kavita Batra, Shelley J Williams, Jeffrey L Ebersole","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep10",NA
"39337137","Elevated Alanine Transaminase-to-Platelet Index (APRI) Is Associated with Obesity and Distinct Forms of Dyslipidemia: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study.","Background: Obesity is a pathological condition and a major risk factor for dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recent research highlighted the association of non-invasive serum markers with these conditions but the clinical utility of ALT APRI in obesity and its relationship with dyslipidemia remain unexplored. Methods: We examined the association of ALT APRI in 165 non-diabetic adults stratified by BMI and serum lipid parameters. Results: Obese subjects had significantly higher APRI than lean subjects, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.65 (p = 0.019). Medians of APRI were significantly increased in subjects with high TG, TG/HDL, TC/HDL, and LDL/HDL and low HDL. Notably, all lipid parameters and ratios were significantly elevated in the highest APRI tertile, compared with patients in the lowest tertile. APRI was weakly yet significantly correlated with BMI (R2 = 0.032, p = 0.022), HDL (R2 = 0.071), TG/HDL (R2 = 0.031), TC/HDL (R2 = 0.063), LDL/HDL (R2 = 0.072), and TyG index (R2 = 0.081). While APRI only showed a discriminating capacity for HDL (AUC: 0.69, p = 0.003), TG/HDL (AUC: 0.63, p = 0.020), LDL/HDL (AUC: 0.68, p < 0.001), and TyG index (AUC: 0.65, p = 0.037), the highest diagnostic performance of APRI was observed with TC/HDL (AUC: 0.74, p < 0.001). Additionally, APRI was a risk factor for high TG (OR: 1.6, p = 0.028), low HDL (OR: 2.7, p = 0.0002), high TG/HDL (OR: 1.94, p = 0.0011), high TC/HDL (OR: 2.3, p < 0.0001), high LDL/HDL (OR: 2.2, p = 0.0001), and high TyG index (OR: 2.1, p = 0.008).

While common risk factors including alcohol consumption, smoking, and metabolic disorders have been well studied in various cancers, their relationship with KS remains unclear. Methods: This study used a cohort approach with adults without AIDS, utilizing data from the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. This study examined various conventional cancer-related risk factors related to the incidence of KS, including psoriasis. Results: Alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and regular exercise were not significantly associated with the incidence of KS. Additionally, older age and male sex were associated with a higher incidence of KS. KS risk was increased in pathological conditions such as psoriasis and proteinuria, which require immunosuppressive medication. Conclusions: Our study suggests that traditional cancer-related risk factors may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of KS, unlike other cancers. This, in turn, emphasizes the importance of immunosuppression and HHV-8 infection in the development of KS.","Ji Eun Shin, Kyungdo Han, Ho Jung An, Hyung Soon Park, Byoung Yong Shim, Hyunho Kim","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep23",NA

This study aims to characterize the distinct clinical and virological features of CHB in the context of MASLD and evaluate its impact on disease progression and outcomes. Methods: Utilizing a comprehensive health maintenance organization database, this study included 1186 patients with CHB from 2000-2020. Patients were categorized into two groups: CHB-MASLD (n = 188) and CHB alone (n = 998). CHB diagnosis was confirmed by serological markers, while MASLD was diagnosed based on imaging and cardiometabolic risk factors. Comparative analysis and multiple regression models were applied to assess variables related to viral parameters and clinical outcomes. Results: The CHB-MASLD group was older (mean age of 45.2 vs. 39.1, p < 0.001) with higher rates of obesity (46.8% vs. 23.8%, p < 0.001), diabetes (36.2% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001), and dyslipidemia. Distinct viral profiles included higher HBeAg negativity (96.2%), a higher rate of HBeAg-negative infection (70.4% vs. 63.8%; p < 0.001), and increased HBeAg seroconversion under treatment. Cirrhosis was more prevalent in the CHB-MASLD group (9.6% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.007), while HCC rates were comparable. Multivariate analysis identified age, male gender, chronic active hepatitis, and diabetes as predictors of cirrhosis. Conclusions: CHB-MASLD patients were distinguished by a higher prevalence of metabolic features, along with a distinct viral profile marked by increased chronic HBeAg infection, higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion, and a potential association with worse disease outcomes.","Fadi Abu Baker, Abdel-Rauf Zeina, Randa Taher, Saif Abu Mouch, Ariel Israel","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep21",NA

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential role of environmental factors in the development of childhood obesity. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between various components of air pollution and childhood obesity. Methods: We systematically analyze the existing literature from the past 5 years to explore the mechanistic pathways linking air pollution, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to childhood obesity. This systematic review examines 33 epidemiological studies on the link between air pollution and childhood obesity, published from 1 January 2018, to 31 January 2024. Results: Studies from counties with low overall air pollution noticed only low to no impact of the exposure to childhood obesity, unlike studies from countries with higher levels of pollution, suggesting that the mitigation of air pollutants can reduce the chance of it being a negative factor for the development of obesity. This relationship was noticed for PM2.5, PM1, PM10, NOx, and SO2 but not for PAHs, which showed a negative effect on children's health across 10 out of 11 studies. Conclusions: This review underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address both environmental and socio-economic determinants of childhood obesity.

"39337085","Factors Affecting Wound Healing after the Wide Surgical Excision of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Lesions.","Background: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and inflammatory disease. Its management depends on the stage and extent of the disease. Surgery plays an important role in treatment options. This study explores the factors influencing healing after wide excision. Methods: This study analyzed data from patients who underwent wide excision for HS between 2016 and 2021. Results: A total of 160 patients (64.4% women) were included, with surgeries performed in the axillae (70), inguinal-ano-genital (73), and other locations (17, including gluteal). The mean TTWC was 74 ± 6 days, varying from 11 to 445 days. Factors negatively influencing TTWC included axillary localization (p < 0.001) and the presence of another inflammatory disease (p = 0.017). Factors positively influencing healing were smoking (<0.001) and previous or ongoing medical treatment (antibiotherapy or biologics) (p = 0.011). Obesity or being overweight did not impact the TTWC in multivariate analysis, although overweight was significant in univariate analysis. Conclusions: While smoking cessation remains important in the management of HS, it does not appear to be a prerequisite for successful surgical treatment. Conversely, patients with an inflammatory disease or those undergoing surgery for an axillary lesion exhibit slower healing and should be informed of potential healing delays before surgery.","Anne-Cecile Ezanno, Gaëtan Texier, Joffrey Marchi, Anne-Claire Fougerousse","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep21",NA

Moreover, bariatric surgery reduced the level of congenital malfunction, but the effect was not statistically significant (p = 0.16), with an RR of 0.39, at a 95% CI (0.10, 1.45). However, the overall effect of bariatric surgery on treating infertility was found to be significantly effective (p = 0.0001), with an RR of 0.54, at a 95% CI (0.43, 0.68). This implies that bariatric surgery helps in weight loss, which improves ovulatory dysfunction and irregular menstruation while boosting spontaneous conception. Conclusions: This study found that bariatric surgery helps infertile women of a reproductive age to lose weight, which improves ovulatory dysfunction and irregular menstruation while boosting spontaneous conception. On the other hand, the study noted that after bariatric surgery, spontaneous conception can occur because of a decreased rate of miscarriage, increased fertility, reduced levels of congenital malfunction, and the restoration of regular menstrual cycles. Therefore, this study highlights the need to offer adequate preconception care and counselling to women who are about to be pregnant, both before and after bariatric surgery. Further, based on the fact that this study focused on general bariatric surgery, future research should focus on specific types of bariatric surgery to establish the most effective type of bariatric surgery in treating infertility in women.","Hadeel Almutairi, Mohammad Sulaiman Aldhalea, Muhammad Abdulghani Almaaz, Sama Abdalaziz Aljuhani, Rena Ibrahim Aloraini, Abdulrahman Abdullah Alamoudi, Wajd Fahad Alkhalifah, Leen Ahmed Alrushaid, Haneen Wadi Alanzy, Meshal Alzuwayyid, Flora Abdulaziz Alrumaih, Moneerah Madeallah Al-Harbi, Alaa Ahmad Al-Aboudi, Faisal Salem Alqadi, Reem Salem Alshammari","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep19",NA

Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 405 nurses. To achieve the study objective, body composition analysis (Tanita MC-980), blood pressure measurement (Welch Allyn 4200B), anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (CardioChek PA), and surveys regarding the consumption of specific food groups were conducted. Results: More than half of the respondents were overweight or/and obese, and almost 40% had elevated blood pressure levels. The results obtained from logistic regression models indicated that the consumption of specific food product groups may predispose to/increase the risk of hypertension, abdominal obesity, overweight, obesity, body fat accumulation, and the risk of cardiovascular events. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of targeted nutritional strategies to enhance the health and professional efficacy of nursing staff, paving the way for improved healthcare practices.","Anna Bartosiewicz, Justyna Wyszyńska, Edyta Łuszczki, Anna Lewandowska, Małgorzata Zatorska-Zoła, Piotr Sulikowski, Piotr Matłosz","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep19",NA
"39337049","Metabolic Side Effects of Risperidone in Pediatric Patients with Neurological Disorders: A Prospective Cohort Study.","Background/Objectives: Risperidone-related metabolic side effects in children have been primarily linked to variations between guideline-recommended and clinical treatment procedures. We explored the metabolic effects of risperidone administration in pediatric patients diagnosed with neurological disorders, thus evaluating its influence on metabolic indicators. Methods: This prospective cohort study gathered data from electronic health records, medical databases, and clinical reports. These data included patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, and body mass index) and information on risperidone use, including dosage, dosing frequency, and treatment duration. Additionally, laboratory tests were conducted at baseline and during treatment, along with other pertinent clinical variables. Result: A total of 52 eligible children (male; 73.1%) with neurological disorders treated with risperidone were included. The mean age was 13.4 ± 2.2 years. Risperidone was administered to 32.7% of patients for <2 years, 40.4% for 2-5 years, and 26.9% for 6-9 years, with a mean duration of 3.6 years. Most (53.8%) of the children experienced at least one metabolic side effect, with hyperlipidemia being the most common (34.6%). The median prolactin level increased slightly from 448.5 ng/mL at baseline to 479 ng/mL after 6-8 weeks. No significant associations were found between age, sex, duration of treatment, dosage form, dosing frequency, and hemoglobin A1c levels. Conclusion: Monitoring metabolic and anthropometric parameters in children receiving risperidone for neurological disorders is cardinal. Clinicians should consider individualized treatment plans, closely monitor metabolic markers, and address potential risks associated with long-term risperidone use in this vulnerable population.","Jawza F Alsabhan, Nouf Backer Al Backer, Fatimah M Hassan, Awatif B Albaker, Ghadeer Assiry","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep19",NA
"39336979","Asthma and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Overlap in a Sample of Older American Indian Adults: The Strong Heart Study.","Study Objectives: Our study aimed to investigate the association between asthma and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in American Indian communities, a historically underrepresented population in clinical research with a high prevalence of asthma and OSA risk factors like smoking and obesity. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data retrieved from the Strong Heart Study cohort. Participants who attended both the Asthma Sub-study and the Sleep Heart Health Study around the same time were compared for active asthma diagnosis, OSA diagnosis, and potential risk factors for asthma and OSA. The association between asthma and OSA was then evaluated. Results: Among the 2480 participants who attended the Strong Heart Study Phase III exam, 123 participated in both the Asthma Sub-study and the Sleep Heart Health Study. Of these, 13 were diagnosed with OSA, with 4 having moderate to severe OSA. There was no statistically significant difference in OSA prevalence between the active asthma group and the non-active asthma group (former asthma or no asthma) (9.6% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.63). Additionally, body mass index did not differ significantly between participants with both active asthma and OSA and those without active asthma, OSA, or both. OSA diagnosis was significantly associated with male sex (Odds Ratio [OR] 9.2 [1.85-45.87], p = 0.007) and body mass index (OR 1.1 [1.02-1.26], p = 0.016) but not with age or a diagnosis of active asthma. Conclusions: In this American Indian cohort, no significant difference in OSA prevalence was observed between participants with and without active asthma, contradicting previous studies. Further research is needed to explore the underlying reasons for this discrepancy.","Huimin Wu, Dorothy A Rhoades, Jessica A Reese, Kellie R Jones","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep17",NA
"39336965","A Longitudinal Decline in Walking Speed Is Linked with Coexisting Hypertension and Arthritis in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.","Objective: The aim was to investigate the association between baseline coexistence of hypertension (HTN) and arthritis, HTN alone, or arthritis alone, and their impact on longitudinal physical function measures among community-dwelling older adults over 5 years of follow-up. Methods: Ours was a longitudinal prospective cohort study from the second wave (2010-2011) and third wave (2015-2016) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Data for older adults were used. Participants were categorized based on self-reported diagnoses into four groups: coexisting HTN and arthritis, HTN only, arthritis only, or neither. Physical performance measures included walking speed using the 3-Meter Walk Test and the Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST). Multiple generalized estimating equations with linear regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI) educational level, pain severity, and baseline use of pain and hypertension medications. Results: Data for 1769 participants were analyzed. Slower walking speed was only associated with coexisting HTN and arthritis (B = -0.43, p < 0.001) after accounting for covariates. The coexisting HTN and arthritis group showed no significant association with FTSST (B = 0.80, p = 0.072) after accounting for covariates. Conclusions: The coexistence of baseline HTN and arthritis in older adults is associated with a gradual decline in only walking speed as a physical performance measure in older adults.","Saud M Alrawaili, Khalid Alkhathami, Mohammed G Elsehrawy, Mohammed S Alghamdi, Hussein M Alkahtani, Norah A Alhwoaimel, Aqeel M Alenazi","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep15",NA
"39336960","Late Hepatocellular Carcinoma Occurrence in Patients Achieving Sustained Virological Response After Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy: A Matter of Follow-Up or Something Else?","Background: Despite achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), an unexpected increase in the occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been observed among HCV-treated patients. This study aims to assess the long-term follow-up of HCV patients treated with DAAs who achieved an SVR to investigate the potential for late-onset HCC. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, we enrolled consecutive HCV patients treated with DAAs following Italian ministerial guidelines between 2015 and 2018. Exclusion criteria included active HCC on imaging, prior HCC treatment, HBV or HIV co-infection, or liver transplant recipients. Monthly follow-ups occurred during treatment, with subsequent assessments every 3 months for at least 48 months. Abdominal ultrasound (US) was performed within two weeks before starting antiviral therapy, supplemented by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), dynamic computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate incidental liver lesions. Results: Of the 306 patients completing the 48-months follow-up post-treatment (median age 67 years, 55% male), all achieved an SVR. A sofosbuvir-based regimen was administered to 72.5% of patients, while 20% received ribavirin. During follow-up, late-onset HCC developed in 20 patients (cumulative incidence rate of 6.55%). The pattern of HCC occurrence varied (median diameter 24 mm). Multivariate and univariate analyses identified liver stiffness, diabetes, body mass index, and platelet levels before antiviral therapy as associated factors for late HCC occurrence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that late HCC occurrence may persist despite achieving SVR. Therefore, comprehensive long-term follow-up, including clinical, laboratory, and expert ultrasonography evaluations, is crucial for all HCV patients treated with DAAs.","Alessandro Perrella, Alfredo Caturano, Ilario de Sio, Pasquale Bellopede, Adelaide Maddaloni, Luigi Maria Vitale, Barbara Rinaldi, Andrea Mormone, Antonio Izzi, Costanza Sbreglia, Francesca Futura Bernardi, Ugo Trama, Massimiliano Berretta, Raffaele Galiero, Erica Vetrano, Ferdinando Carlo Sasso, Gianluigi Franci, Raffaele Marfella, Luca Rinaldi","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep14",NA
"39336931","Screening Strategies to Improve Early Diagnosis in Endometrial Cancer.","Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in high-income countries and the sixth most common cancer in women. Overall incidence has risen in the last few decades as a consequence of the increase in the prevalence of its risk factors, mainly obesity and the aging of the population, and although diagnoses have increased across all age groups, the incidence rates have doubled in women under the age of 40 years. The survival rates of endometrial cancer are highly dependent on its stage at diagnosis, bringing to the fore the importance of early diagnosis. The aim of a screening strategy in this type of tumor should be to detect the disease in the pre-invasive or early stage (before developing myometrial invasion), which would improve cure rates, reduce the morbidity associated with aggressive treatment and offer uterus-sparing management options for younger women. The ideal screening tool in this scenario would be a minimally invasive, inexpensive and easy-to-perform test or auto-test, which could be implemented in a routine gynecologic checkup of patients at-risk or in the general adult population. In this comprehensive review, we aim to define the populations at higher risk of developing endometrial cancer, to assess the performance of current diagnostic tools when used in a screening setting and to discuss the accuracy of new molecular screening strategies.","Silvia Cabrera, Irene de la Calle, Sonia Baulies, Antonio Gil-Moreno, Eva Colas","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep13",NA
"39336930","Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy in Achilles and Patellar Tendinopathies: Outcomes in Subjects with Diabetes (A Retrospective Case-Control Study).","Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a high risk of chronic degenerative Achilles (AT) and Patellar (PT) tendinopathies and ruptures. Growth factors (GFs) synthesis in diabetics is substantially decreased in human connective tissues, including in tendons. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), which is enriched in GFs, might prove of great help in tendon healing. The aim of the study was to assess whether pre-existent DM or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) could influence the clinical outcome in subjects undergoing PRP treatment. Methods: Sixty subjects with diabetes/pre-diabetes and sixty euglycemic controls, matched for sex and age, were enrolled. Patients suffering from proximal insertional PT and mid-portion AT, treated with PRP therapy, were included in the study. To assess the basal status and the efficacy of the therapy after 3 and 6 months, the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) questionnaire and the Ultrasound methodology study were used. Patient satisfaction was assessed by means of the Likert Scale. Results: In the population study at 6 months, the mean VISA-score increased (8.92 ± 0.67; p-value < 0.001). The improvement in the diabetic group was less evident compared to the controls (-2.76 ± 0.95; p-value = 0.003). Even though the improvement was poor, it was still significant. MCID analysis revealed that diabetics had higher risk of therapeutic unsuccess. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess factors associated with unsatisfactory results (Likert-scale) of PRP treatment: AT (O.R.: 3.05; 95%CI: 1.40-6.64; p-value = 0.005), higher BMI values (O.R.: 1.02; 95%CI: 1.01-1.04; p-value = 0.01), and lower VISA score values at baseline (O.R.: 0.95; 95%CI: 0.90-0.99; p-value = 0.04). Conclusions: PRP treatment in AT and PT chronic tendinopathies resulted in less favorable results in subjects with diabetes compared with euglycemic subjects. Moreover, the subjects with PT showed better results than those with AT.","Michele Abate, Roberto Paganelli, Raffaello Pellegrino, Angelo Di Iorio, Vincenzo Salini","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep13",NA
"39336890","Real-World Impact of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Endoscopic Patient Outcomes in an Ambulatory Setting: A Retrospective Study at a Large Tertiary Center.","Background: Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are associated with delayed gastric emptying and may increase the risk of aspiration due to retained gastric contents. There are no guidelines on peri-endoscopic use of GLP-1 RAs, and real-world outcomes in an ambulatory setting remain unknown. This study reports real-world data from an ambulatory center associated with a large tertiary hospital. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted for patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at a hospital-based outpatient center from January to June 2023. Exclusions included non-elective procedures, current opioid use, altered foregut anatomy, and known gastroparesis. All patients were on GLP-1 RAs before endoscopy and followed standard fasting protocols. Adverse event rates were recorded, and patients were divided into cohorts based on GLP-1 RA use. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses identified risk factors for food retention and complications. Results: A total of 1438 patients underwent elective EGD during the study period. Among the 1046 patients included, 73 (7%) were on GLP-1 RAs. The procedure was aborted in four patients (0.4%) due to gastric food retention, with two (50%) on GLP-1 RAs. Independent risk factors for food retention included GLP-1 RA use (OR: 9.19; 95% CI: 2.73-30.8; p = 0.0003) and diabetes (OR 5.6; 95% CI: 1.72-18.2; p = 0.004). Tirzepatide showed the strongest association (p = 0.0056). Factors that did not impact food retention included A1c, BMI, and gender. Protective factors were age (OR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99; p = 0.02) and same-day colonoscopy (OR 0.18; 95% CI: 0.06-0.58; p = 0.003). Conclusions: GLP-1 RA use in diabetics increases the risk of retained gastric contents during elective EGD, particularly with tirzepatide, without increasing aspiration risk. Patients undergoing simultaneous colonoscopy had a lower risk of retained gastric contents. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on gastric food retention and procedural risk.","Ernesto Robalino Gonzaga, Aimen Farooq, Abdul Mohammed, Saurabh Chandan, Baha Fawwaz, Gurdeep Singh, Amna Malik, Yiyang Zhang, Kambiz Kadkhodayan","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep12",NA
"39336874","Myoinositol and Metformin in the Prevention of Gestational Diabetes in High-Risk Patients: A Narrative Review.","Our hypothesis is that myoinositol and metformin in pregnant women with high-risk factors for glucose intolerance would reduce insulin resistance and consequently lower the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a metabolic disorder of pregnancy characterized by maternal hyperglycemia due to deficient response to physiological insulin resistance, which may have a negative impact on perinatal outcome and long-term sequelae. In recent years, this pathology has become increasingly important given the global obesity epidemic and the delay in becoming pregnant, especially in industrialized countries. For this reason, the attempt to prevent, rather than cure, gestational diabetes is particularly important. In addition to lifestyle changes (especially diet and doing more exercise), myoinositol and metformin are the most promising factors at the moment, although not all RCTs published so far agree on their real effectiveness. A review of the articles published so far allows us to assume, albeit with some distinctions, that they can play a positive role.","Paola Romeo, Rosario D'Anna, Francesco Corrado","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep12",NA
"39336869","The Association of Weight Categories in Adolescence with Cardiovascular Morbidity in Young Adult Israeli Arabs-A Nationwide Study.","Objectives. The health consequences of adolescent obesity are understudied in young adult Israeli Arabs. We aimed to evaluate the association of weight categories during adolescence with hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and the composite endpoint of ischemic stroke (IS), myocardial infarction (MI), and heart failure (HF) in young adult Israeli Arabs on a nationwide level. Methods. A retrospective cohort study of 53,726 Arab adolescents born from 1988-1992 was conducted. The cohort was followed, beginning with BMI measurements at ages 17-19 years, until whichever came first among the diagnosis of outcome disease, death, discontinuation of health insurance, or age of 30 years. Results. The incidence (95% CI) of HTN, DM2, and the composite endpoint of IS, MI, and HF was 138.2 (129.1-147.9), 136.7 (127.6-146.3), and 27.3 (23.3-31.7) cases per 105 person-years, respectively. The risk for DM and HTN increased gradually, starting from the 'overweight' category, and reaching fully adjusted HRs (95% CI) of 2.80 (1.82-4.30), and 1.97 (1.31-2.96), respectively, in the 'class 3 obesity' category. The Hazard ratio (HR) for the composite endpoint, its incidence and components, was highest in the 'overweight' category (aHR of 1.64 (1.08-2.50)). Conclusions. The findings emphasize the long-term health consequences of adolescent obesity in early adulthood and, hence, the need for interventions aimed at reducing the rate of adolescent overweight and obesity. The finding of a very high rate of DM2 incidence in early adulthood, even among adolescents without obesity, necessitates an integrated public health approach to all risk factors to prevent DM2 in this population.","Yulia Treister-Goltzman, Dan Nemet, Idan Menashe","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep11",NA

The objective of this study was to evaluate the overall satisfaction and predictors of satisfaction with VS in patients with knee osteoarthritis treated with VS. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study in patients with knee OA treated with one injection of a mannitol-modified cross-linked HA (HANOX-M-XL). The primary outcome was satisfaction, self-assessed semi-quantitatively by the patients. Demographics, radiological features, comorbidities, OA and comorbidities treatments, and lifestyle associated with satisfaction were studied in bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: 89 patients (124 knees) were analyzed. A total of 88.7% were satisfied with the treatment. Satisfaction was correlated with duration of effectiveness (DoE) and negatively correlated with BMI. Satisfaction was higher in active versus sedentary patients, in tibiofemoral involvement, in Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1-3 versus 4, and in subjects not requiring intraarticular corticosteroid (IACS) concomitantly to VS. Satisfied subjects were older than dissatisfied ones. In multivariate analysis, older age, K-L grade < 4, absence of IACS, and longer DoE were associated with higher rates of satisfaction. Conclusions: We identified several predictive factors of patient satisfaction after VS of the knee. Alongside these objective factors, there are probably subjective factors linked to patient beliefs, fears, and expectations impacting satisfaction.","Martin Balblanc, Anne Lohse, Frederic Meyer, Charles Rapp, Charlotte Bourgoin, Jean-Charles Balblanc, Thierry Conrozier","Journal of clinical medicine","2024Sep11",NA
"39336763","Epidemiological Study on the Interaction between the PNPLA3 (rs738409) and Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.","Many factors are associated with the development and progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); however, genetics and gut microbiota are representative factors. Recent studies have highlighted the link between host genes and the gut microbiota. Although there have been many studies on the separate effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gut bacteria on MASLD, few epidemiological studies have examined how SNPs and gut bacteria interact in the development and progression of MASLD. This study aimed to investigate the association between PNPLA3 rs738409, a representative MASLD-related SNP, and gut bacteria in MASLD using a cross-sectional study of the general population. The 526 participants (318 normal and 208 MASLD groups) were grouped into the PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP, CC, CG, and GG genotypes, and the differences in the gut microbiota were investigated in each group. The PNPLA3 rs738409 CC and CG genotypes were associated with decreased Blautia and Ruminococcaceae in the MASLD group. They were negatively correlated with controlled attenuation parameter levels, body mass index, serum blood glucose, and triglycerides. In contrast, there was no association between the normal and MASLD groups and the gut bacteria in the PNPLA3 rs738409, the GG genotype group. This finding implies that dietary interventions and probiotics may be more effective in preventing and treating MASLD in individuals with the PNPLA3 rs738409 CC and CG genotypes. In contrast, their efficacy may be limited in those with the GG genotype.","Satoshi Sato, Chikara Iino, Takafumi Sasada, Go Soma, Keisuke Furusawa, Kenta Yoshida, Kaori Sawada, Tatsuya Mikami, Shigeyuki Nakaji, Hirotake Sakuraba, Shinsaku Fukuda","Genes","2024Sep06","Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Membrane Proteins; Male; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Middle Aged; Lipase; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Aged; Fatty Liver; Genotype; Acyltransferases; Phospholipases A2, Calcium-Independent"

Although genetically predisposed individuals are more prone to developing obesity, it has been shown that physical activity can modify the genetic predisposition to obesity. Therefore, genetic data obtained from earlier studies, including 30 polymorphisms located in 18 genes, were analyzed using novel methods such as the total genetic score and Biofilter 2.4 software to combine genotypic and phenotypic information for nine obesity-related traits measured before and after the realization of the 12-week training program. The results revealed six genes whose genotypes were most important for post-training changes-LEP, LEPR, ADIPOQ, ADRA2A, ADRB3, and DRD2. Five noteworthy pairwise interactions, LEP × LEPR, ADRB2 × ADRB3, ADRA2A × ADRB3, ADRA2A × ADRB2, ADRA2A × DRD2, and three specific interactions demonstrating significant associations with key parameters crucial for health, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and fat-free mass (FFM), were also identified.

Adipolin is a new adipokine with reduced circulating levels in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objectives: Our prospective case-control study aimed to evaluate the maternal serum levels of adipolin and adiponectin, metabolic parameters, and anthropometric characteristics at the time of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in pregnant women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 Kg/m2 and correlate them with newborn adipolin, adiponectin levels, and anthropometric characteristics of the newborns, and secondly to evaluate pregnancy outcomes. Material and Methods: After the OGTT results, we had 44 OW/OB pregnant women with GDM, 30 OW/OB pregnant women without GDM, and 92 lean healthy (LH) pregnant women. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and correlation tests, with a p-value < 0.05 considered significant. Results: We found no differences between adipolin values of the OW/OB pregnant women with GDM and the LH group (p > 0.99), OW/OB without GDM and the LH group (p = 0.56), and between OW/OB groups (p = 0.57). OW/OB pregnant women with GDM had a higher rate of gestational hypertension compared with the LH group (p < 0.0001). Newborns from OW/OB pregnant women with GDM were more frequently diagnosed with jaundice (p = 0.02), and they required more frequent admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for treatment of respiratory distress (p = 0.01) compared with newborns from LH mothers. Conclusions: Our study revealed that the serum levels of adipolin in the second trimester among the group of OW/OB pregnant women with GDM, matched for age and BMI with OW/OB pregnant women without GDM, were not significantly different. This suggests that adipolin may not play an essential role in the occurrence of GDM in these patients. Despite good glycemic control during pregnancy, OW/OB pregnant women with GDM and their newborns tend to have more complications (gestational hypertension, jaundice, NICU admission) than LH pregnant women and their newborns, highlighting the importance of weight control before pregnancy.","Muntean Mihai, Săsăran Vladut, Luca Sonia-Teodora, Suciu Laura Mihaela, Nyulas Victoria, Muntean Irina Elena, Mărginean Claudiu","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep20","Humans; Pregnancy; Female; Diabetes, Gestational; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Prospective Studies; Pilot Projects; Adiponectin; Pregnancy Outcome; Adipokines; Obesity; Overweight; Infant, Newborn; Body Mass Index; Glucose Tolerance Test"
"39336575","Bariatric Surgery and Metabolic Status.","Background and Objectives: Obesity is associated with numerous co-morbidities, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. Bariatric surgery is the mainstay of treatment for obesity as the only method with confirmed long-term effects in weight reduction and the remission of comorbidities. Postoperative recommendations leading to changes in dietary habits and changes in digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract after bariatric surgery may additionally influence the levels of laboratory parameters that reflect the metabolic and nutritional status. The purpose of the study was to analyze the possible influence of changes in dietary habits after bariatric surgery on those laboratory results that reflect the metabolic and nutritional status. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 88 patients with a history of bariatric surgery. Data were gathered from before the surgery and at 6 months after the surgery and included diet structure and selected laboratory parameters reflecting the metabolic and nutritional status, i.e., levels of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, proteins, ferrum, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin D and calcium, the red blood cell count and the hematocrit. Results: Postoperative festive glucose levels were reduced by 14% and were more significant in patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. There was an increase of 22% in concentrations of high-density lipoproteins. Triglyceride concentrations were reduced by 32%. Aminotransferase levels decreased by 43% for alanine aminotransferase and by 14% for aspartate aminotransferase. Among the changes in dietary habits, post-bariatric patients had a reduced consumption of red meat and an increased consumption of fish, milk and dairy products and wholegrain products. Vitamin D and ferrum levels were higher after the surgery, whereas vitamin B12 and folic acid levels remained unchanged. Conclusions: Improved dietary habits of patients after bariatric surgery may lead to changes in laboratory parameters that reflect the ameliorated metabolic and nutritional status of patients after bariatric surgery.","Anna Różańska-Walędziak, Krzysztof Wyszomirski, Małgorzata Kaszuba, Anna Mierzejewska, Ewa Skopińska, Maciej Walędziak","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Bariatric Surgery; Middle Aged; Adult; Nutritional Status; Blood Glucose; Glycated Hemoglobin; Obesity; Feeding Behavior"

Materials and Methods: The prospective longitudinal and single-center study included 43 pregnant women ages 18 to 43. Routine pregnancy follow-up began at the first antenatal examination for all pregnant women before 14 weeks gestation, with IMA levels measured during the first, second, and third trimesters. The albumin cobalt binding test was used to determine the amount of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). The patients' medical, sociodemographic, and nutritional data were analyzed. The primary outcome was to investigate how changes in maternal ischemia affected albumin levels during pregnancy and the relationship between these changes and newborn weight. Results: This study included 43 cases with a mean age of 28.5 ± 5.2 years and a mean gestation period of 39.2 ± 1.3 weeks. The mean IMA levels for cases in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester were 0.53 ± 0.06, 0.64 ± 0.11, and 0.64 ± 0.06, respectively. The second and third trimesters showed significantly higher levels of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) than the first trimester (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in IMA levels between the second and third trimesters (p = 1.000; p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between fetal birth and percentage changes in IMA measurements between the first and second trimesters, the first and third trimesters, or the second and third trimesters (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our study determined that maternal ischemia-modified albumin levels during pregnancy did not correlate with fetal birth weight. Our findings revealed that age, sociodemographic changes, BMI, weight gain, and pregnancy complications had no effect on the change in IMA levels during pregnancy. We believe that this result will serve as a benchmark for future studies on IMA levels during pregnancy.","Uğur Çobanoğlu, Özer Birge, Mustafa Çetin, Emine Seda Güvendağ Güven","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep19","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Prospective Studies; Serum Albumin, Human; Birth Weight; Longitudinal Studies; Adolescent; Biomarkers; Infant, Newborn; Young Adult"
"39336541","The Impact of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms (FokI, ApaI, TaqI) in Correlation with Oxidative Stress and Hormonal and Dermatologic Manifestations in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.","Background and Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent and complex multidisciplinary disorder. Data regarding the role of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism in PCOS are as-yet elusive but suggest an association of VDR (vitamin D receptor) and vitamin D levels with metabolic, endocrine and cutaneous manifestations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and cutaneous manifestations, to find a correlation between hormonal parameters, oxidative stress and skin manifestations in women with PCOS, and to determine the impact of VDR gene polymorphisms on these parameters. Materials and Methods: This case-control study included 39 controls and 46 women with PCOS, matched by age and BMI distribution. Acne, hirsutism, seborrhea, androgenetic alopecia, oxidative stress and androgen hormones were recorded. VDR gene polymorphisms ApaI, FokI and TaqI were examined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism, and the androgen hormone (total testosterone, DHEAS), SHBG and malondialdehyde levels were assessed. Results: The most frequent skin manifestations in PCOS cases were acne followed by seborrhea, hirsutism and androgenic alopecia. The VDR-FokI polymorphism CC genotype had a significant protective role in the odds of acne (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.70], p = 0.015, p-corrected = 0.040) and seborrhea (OR = 0.15, 95% CI: [0.03, 0.75], p = 0.019, p-corrected = 0.039). The results demonstrated a significant protective effect of the C allele on the odds of acne and seborrhea in PCOS cases. Moreover, the dominant genotype of VDR-TaqI could have a protective role against oxidative stress (lower MDA levels) compared to patients carrying the TT genotype. Conclusions: In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that the FokI CC genotype may have a protective role against both acne and seborrhea in women with PCOS, while the VDR-TaqI dominant genotype is associated with diminished oxidative stress in PCOS patients.","Vulcan Talida, Suciu Sergiu Tudor, Iancu Mihaela, Mitrea Daniela-Rodica, Filip Gabriela A, Procopciuc Lucia Maria","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep14","Humans; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Female; Receptors, Calcitriol; Oxidative Stress; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Acne Vulgaris; Polymorphism, Genetic; Hirsutism; Alopecia; Young Adult"
"39336506","Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Elderly Patients: Clinical and Therapeutical Outcomes-A Review of the Literature.","The management of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in elderly patients presents unique challenges due to its chronic inflammatory nature, heterogeneous clinical presentation and comorbidities. While HS typically affects the anogenital and intertriginous regions, elderly patients may exhibit atypical features such as the involvement of the neck, mammary area and gluteal region. The prevalence of HS in the elderly population is lower and the average age of disease onset is higher than in patients under 65. In contrast, it is unclear whether HS in the elderly has different clinical features. The elderly frequently present multiple comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, which further complicate management decisions. Therapeutic interventions must consider the frailty and increased risk of multimorbidity and adverse events in elderly patients. While systemic antibiotics remain a mainstay of HS treatment, biologic agents such as TNFα inhibitors and secukinumab offer promising options for refractory cases. However, their safety and efficacy in elderly patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities, require careful consideration. A comprehensive approach to managing HS in elderly patients involves not only pharmacological interventions but also lifestyle modifications and surgical options where appropriate. Multidisciplinary collaboration between dermatologists, geriatricians and other specialists is essential for tailoring treatment strategies and optimizing long-term outcomes and quality of life in special population.","Fabrizio Martora, Nello Tommasino, Claudio Brescia, Luca Potestio, Teresa Battista, Matteo Megna","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep06","Humans; Hidradenitis Suppurativa; Aged; Female; Comorbidity; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Treatment Outcome"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the inflammatory potential of a diet and thyroid function in adults with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Materials and Methods: A total of 149 adults diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were enrolled in this observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) was calculated using a 141-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The serum levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined. Results: The DII® scores ranged from -3.49 (most anti-inflammatory) to +4.68 (most pro-inflammatory), whereas three DII® tertile ranges were defined as <-1.4, -1.39 to +1.20, and >+1.21, respectively. Participants in tertile 1 (more anti-inflammatory diet) had significantly higher levels of fT4 than those adhering to a more pro-inflammatory diet (p = 0.007). The levels of hsCRP and TSH appeared to increase with increasing the DII® score, but without statistical significance. A significant association was found between the DII® and TSH (β = 0.42, p < 0.001) and between DII® and free thyroxine (β = 0.19, p < 0.001). After adjustment for age, gender, energy intake, and physical activity, a significant positive correlation remained between the DII® and TSH (β = 0.33, p = 0.002) and between the DII® and body mass index (BMI) (β = 0.14, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet appears to be beneficial in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, suggesting that dietary modification aimed at lowering DII® levels may be a valuable strategy to improve clinical outcomes in these patients.","Sanja Klobučar, Gordana Kenđel Jovanović, Jadwiga Kryczyk-Kozioł, Maja Cigrovski Berković, Jelena Vučak Lončar, Nikolina Morić, Katarina Peljhan, Dario Rahelić, Dunja Mudri, Ines Bilić-Ćurčić, Tatjana Bogović Crnčić","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep05","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hashimoto Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Diet; Thyrotropin; Inflammation; Thyroxine; C-Reactive Protein; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Function Tests"

The aim of the present retrospective clinical study was to analyze the clinical outcomes and survivorship of medial and lateral UKA with a newly designed all-polyethylene tibial plateau at short-term follow-up. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected consecutive patients who underwent medial or lateral UKA with AP tibial plateau was conducted, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Primary outcomes were clinical score (VAS, OKS, and KOOS) variations from baseline up to the latest follow-up. Secondary outcomes were Likert scale variations from baseline to the follow-up, evaluation of the influence of demographic factors (age and BMI) at the time of surgery on the clinical outcomes, and evaluation of revision rate up to the last follow-up. Results: The final study population included 99 knees. The mean VAS score for the medial group significantly decreased from 7.61 ± 1.65 (pre-intervention) to 2.74 ± 2.26 (post-intervention). Similar improvements were registered for the OKS as well, for both the medial group (from 22.5 ± 12.6 to 36.6 ± 10.6, with a delta of 14.11 (10.05 to 18.17)) and the lateral group (from 22.6 ± 12.6 to 36.9 ± 11.8, with a delta of 14.24 (8.65 to 19.83)). Moreover, all the KOOS subscales reported an amelioration, both in medial UKA and lateral UKA. Furthermore, a logistic regression of delta VAS was performed in relation to the other clinical questionnaires and the demographic factors. For both medial and lateral UKAs, no statistically significant correlation was found between the VAS scale regression and the demographic factors. The survival rate free from any revision of the cohort at the latest follow-up was 96.32%.

"39336491","Impact of Patient- and Surgeon-Related Factors on Weight Loss after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy-A Single-Center Study.","Background and Objectives: Surgical treatment for obesity is becoming increasingly popular. Surgeons have been trying to find a simple way to predict the type of surgical intervention that is best for a specific patient. This study aimed to determine the patient- and surgeon-related factors that affect weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Materials and Methods: A total of 129 patients underwent LSG in one surgical department. The following factors were analyzed: gender; age; highest preoperative and 6-month postoperative weight; the occurrence of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension; the number of surgeons involved in the surgery; and who performed the surgery, a resident or specialist. The outcomes also included length of hospital stay, operative time and complications. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Results: A total of 129 patients (94 female) with a median age of 43 years and BMI of 43.1 kg/m2 underwent LSG, while a total of 109 (84.5%) patients achieved ≥50% of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL). Preoperative weight loss had no impact on %EBMIL (p = 0.95), operative time (p = 0.31) and length of hospital stay (p = 0.2). Two versus three surgeons in the operating team had no impact on surgery time (p = 0.1), length of stay (p = 0.98) and %EBMIL (p = 0.14). The operative time and length of hospital stay were similar for specialists and surgeons in training. %EBMIL was higher in the residents' surgery without statistical significance (p = 0.19). Complications occurred in 3.9% without mortality or leaks. Conclusions: Preoperative comorbidities, surgeons' experience and the number of surgeons in the operating team do not impact the complication rate, length of hospital stay, operative time and postoperative weight loss after LSG.","Mateusz Wityk, Natalia Dowgiałło-Gornowicz, Maciej Bobowicz","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep04","Humans; Female; Male; Weight Loss; Gastrectomy; Adult; Laparoscopy; Middle Aged; Length of Stay; Operative Time; Treatment Outcome; Surgeons; Body Mass Index; Obesity, Morbid; Retrospective Studies"

Materials and Methods: It recruited consecutive patients undergoing instrumented fusion from L1 to the sacrum for degenerative lumbar disease between June 2006 and November 2019 in a single institution. The patients' preoperative clinical data, muscle status at T12-L1 on magnetic resonance images, and sagittal spinopelvic parameters were analyzed. Univariate analysis was used to compare clinical and radiographic data between PJK and non-PJK patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the independent risk factors for PJK. Results: A total of 56 patients were included in this study. The mean age at surgery was 67.3 years and mean follow-up period was 37.3 months. In total, 10 were male and 46 were female. PJK developed in 23 (41.1%) out of 56; of these patients, 20 (87.0%) developed PJK within 1 year postoperatively. In the univariate analysis between PJK and non-PJK patients, the PJK group showed more frequent osteoporosis, lower body mass index, smaller cross-sectional area (CSA) and more fat infiltration (FI) in erector spinae muscle at T12-L1 and larger preoperative TLK and PT with statistical significance (p < 0.05). In the logistic regression analysis, severe (>50%) FI in erector spinae muscle (OR = 43.60, CI 4.10-463.06, R2N = 0.730, p = 0.002) and osteoporosis (OR = 20.49, CI 1.58-264.99, R2N = 0.730, p = 0.021) were statistically significant. Conclusions: Preexisting severe (>50%) fat infiltration in the erector spinae muscle and osteoporosis were independent risk factors associated with PJK following instrumented fusion from L1 to the sacrum, but age was not a risk factor.","Joonghyun Ahn, Young-Hoon Kim, Yong-Chan Kim, Ki-Tack Kim, Sung-Min Kim, Jun Bum Park, Kee-Yong Ha","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Sep03","Humans; Male; Female; Spinal Fusion; Kyphosis; Aged; Risk Factors; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Sacrum; Lumbar Vertebrae; Postoperative Complications; Age Factors; Logistic Models"
"39336459","Relationship between Marriage and Prediabetes among Healthcare Workers: Mediating Effect of Triglycerides.","Background and Objectives: In the literature, relationships between being married and having prediabetes or diabetes are inconsistent. We aimed to investigate whether marriage is a protective or risk factor for prediabetes and to uncover new insights into its impact on prediabetes. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, questionnaires were distributed by email to 1039 staff members who participated in an employee health check from a hospital affiliated with a medical university in Taiwan. Fasting blood glucose and triglyceride (TG) levels were checked and the questionnaires elicited basic demographic characteristics and included the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, and mediation analysis were conducted for statistical analysis. Results: Among the group aged 20-37 years, married (OR = 1.89, 95%CI: 1.08, 3.33), obesity (OR = 2.95, 95%CI: 1.49, 5.83), neck and shoulder pain (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.69), and elevated TG levels (OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.01) were independent risk factors for prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose). For those >38 years old, overweight (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 1.27, 3.43), obesity (OR = 4.30, 95%CI: 2.38, 7.79), and elevated triglyceride (TG) (OR = 1.003, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.01) were the independent risk factors for impaired fasting glucose. Increased TG levels serve as a mediating factor (Zm = 2.64, p < 0.01) linking marriage to an increased risk of prediabetes for the group aged 20-37 years. Conclusions: TGs play a significant role in the association between marriage and prediabetes among the group aged 20-37 years. Therefore, dietary habits, especially those of young adult couples should be considered.

"39336439","Identifying Early Risk Factors for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications in Cardiac Surgery Patients.","Background and Objectives: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common in patients who undergo cardiac surgery and are widely acknowledged as significant contributors to increased morbidity, mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and healthcare costs. Clinical manifestations of PPCs can vary from mild to severe symptoms, with different radiological findings and varying incidence. Detecting early signs and identifying influencing factors of PPCs is essential to prevent patients from further complications. Our study aimed to determine the frequency, types, and risk factors significant for each PPC on the first postoperative day. The main goal of this study was to identify the incidence of pleural effusion (right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral), atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax as well as detect specific factors related to its development. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective single-center trial. It involved 314 adult patients scheduled for elective open-heart surgery under CPB. Results: Of the 314 patients reviewed, 42% developed PPCs within 12 h post-surgery. Up to 60.6% experienced one PPC, while 35.6% developed two PPCs. Pleural effusion was the most frequently observed complication in 89 patients. Left-sided effusion was the most common, presenting in 45 cases. Regression analysis showed a significant association between left-sided pleural effusion development and moderate hypoalbuminemia. Valve surgery was associated with reduced risk for left-sided effusion. Independent parameters for bilateral effusion include increased urine output and longer ICU stays. Higher BMI was inversely related to the risk of pulmonary edema. Conclusions: At least one PPC developed in almost half of the patients. Left-sided pleural effusion was the most common PPC, with hypoalbuminemia as a risk factor for effusion development. Atelectasis was the second most common. Bilateral effusion was the third most common PPC, significantly related to increased urine output. BMI was an independent risk factor for pulmonary edema development.","Kaspars Setlers, Anastasija Jurcenko, Baiba Arklina, Ligita Zvaigzne, Olegs Sabelnikovs, Peteris Stradins, Eva Strike","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Aug26","Humans; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Postoperative Complications; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Aged; Pleural Effusion; Pulmonary Edema; Adult; Lung Diseases; Pneumothorax; Incidence; Pulmonary Atelectasis"
"39336427","Anti-Müllerian Hormone Level Determinants among Non-Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome Women Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study.","Background and Objectives: The anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a crucial biomarker in regulating ovarian follicle development and female fertility. AMH levels predict ovarian responses in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, helping clinicians tailor treatment strategies. This study aims to determine whether thyroid autoimmunity, age, body mass index (BMI), sexual hormone levels, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels influence serum AMH in non-polycystic-ovary-syndrome (PCOS) euthyroid women. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study examined 52 female patients at Zygota Fertility Clinic between 2018 and 2022. Women aged 20-45 years with regular menstrual cycles were included, while conditions such as abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, PCOS, and systemic autoimmune diseases were excluded. A number of parameters were measured in the study, including the subjects' age, BMI, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum free thyroxine (fT4), TSH, various antibodies, and a range of reproductive hormones. An analysis of the relationships between AMH and other variables was conducted using Spearman's correlation coefficient, and an assessment of the impact of confounding factors on AMH levels was conducted using a multivariable linear regression model. Results: The results revealed significant negative correlations between AMH levels and age (rho: -0.484, p < 0.001) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (rho: -0.550, p < 0.001), while positive correlations existed between AMH and estradiol (rho: 0.352, p = 0.011) and total testosterone (rho: 0.542, p < 0.001). No significant correlations were found between AMH levels and BMI, LH, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Conclusions: In this study, ovarian reserve was influenced by age, estradiol, and total testosterone in non-PCOS euthyroid women undergoing IVF. Conversely, BMI and vitamin D status did not significantly impact AMH levels. In order to better understand and possibly manage ovarian reserve, a holistic approach is absolutely essential, taking into account age, weight, hormonal balance, nutrition, and thyroid health.","Melinda Kolcsar, László Szabó, Renáta Mihály, Erzsébet Rozália Vass, Zsolt Gáll","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","2024Aug24","Humans; Female; Anti-Mullerian Hormone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Retrospective Studies; Adult; Fertilization in Vitro; Vitamin D; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Thyrotropin; Biomarkers; Young Adult"
"39336089","The Constellation of Risk Factors and Paraneoplastic Syndromes in Cholangiocarcinoma: Integrating the Endocrine Panel Amid Tumour-Related Biology (A Narrative Review).","Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs), a heterogeneous group of challenging malignant tumours which originate from the biliary epithelium, are associated with an alarming increasing incidence during recent decades that varies between different regions of the globe. Thus, awareness represents the key operating factor. Our purpose was to overview the field of CCAs following a double perspective: the constellation of the risk factors, and the presence of the paraneoplastic syndromes, emphasizing the endocrine features amid the entire multidisciplinary panel. This is a narrative review. A PubMed-based search of English-language original articles offered the basis of this comprehensive approach. Multiple risk factors underlying different levels of statistical evidence have been listed such as chronic biliary diseases and liver conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, parasitic infections (e.g., Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis), lifestyle influence (e.g., alcohol, smoking), environmental exposure (e.g., thorotrast, asbestos), and certain genetic and epigenetic interplays. With regard to the endocrine panel, a heterogeneous spectrum should be taken into consideration: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and potential connections with vitamin D status, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, or the galanin system, respectively, with exposure to sex hormone therapy. Amid the numerous dermatologic, hematologic, renal, and neurologic paraneoplastic manifestations in CCAs, the endocrine panel is less described. Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy stands as the most frequent humoral paraneoplastic syndrome in CCAs, despite being exceptional when compared to other paraneoplastic (non-endocrine) manifestations and to its reported frequency in other (non-CCAs) cancers (it accompanies 20-30% of all cancers). It represents a poor prognosis marker in CCA; it may be episodic once the tumour relapses. In addition to the therapy that targets the originating malignancy, hypercalcaemia requires the administration of bisphosphonates (e.g., intravenous zoledronic acid) or denosumab. Early detection firstly helps the general wellbeing of a patient due to a prompt medical control of high serum calcium and it also provides a fine biomarker of disease status in selected cases that harbour the capacity of PTHrP secretion. The exact molecular biology and genetic configuration of CCAs that display such endocrine traits is still an open matter, but humoral hypercalcaemia adds to the overall disease burden.","Mihai-Lucian Ciobica, Bianca-Andreea Sandulescu, Liana-Maria Chicea, Mihaela Iordache, Maria-Laura Groseanu, Mara Carsote, Claudiu Nistor, Ana-Maria Radu","Biology","2024Aug26",NA

For the next stage of the study, the responses of 74 participants who completed the EDE-Q-6 questionnaire and the Canadian Food Intake Screener were analyzed. The symptoms of eating disorders were identified in 38.9% of the respondents (SCOFF ≥ 2). The global score of the EDE-Q-6 was 2.00 ± 1.81 where subscales such as body shape concerns (2.93 ± 1.44) and weight concerns (2.68 ± 1.36) were the most important factors that young people paid attention to. The severity of eating disorders was 3.20 for males and 2.62 for females, where a score of 4 and above is classified as an eating disorder. Participants with eating disorder symptoms had a higher BMI, with females having a BMI of 22.5 (normal weight) and 25.5 for males (overweight). The study sample had a poor diet, as the Healthy Eating Index was 8.7 with a maximum score of 24. Weak negative correlations were found between eating disorder severity and eating habits.

"39335936","Effect of Nuts Combined with Energy Restriction on the Obesity Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.","Obesity is a multifactorial disease that is difficult to control worldwide. Although nuts are recognized health foods, the application of food in obesity management is unclear. We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate if nut consumption favors people on energy restriction (ER) dietary interventions. Four databases were used to search for eligible articles in May 2024. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guide, and the bias risk of papers was evaluated. For the meta-analysis, we extracted the endpoint values of the group's variables and estimated the effect sizes by the random-effects model. Sixteen and ten articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Almonds were evaluated in the majority of studies (n = 6). The consumption of nuts (28 to 84 g/d, 4 to 72 months) included in ER (-250 to 1000 kcal/d) did not differently affect anthropometry (weight loss, BMI, waist and hip circumferences), body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass, or lean mass), markers of glucose (glycemia and insulinemia), lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c, or triglycerides), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In most analyses, stratifying studies by type of nut or intervention time did not present different results in the meta-analysis. As there are few studies, in addition to great methodological variability, more high-quality trials are needed to confirm these results.

"39335760","Distal Transradial Access Optimization: A Prospective Trial of Ultrasound-Guided Radial Artery Characterization for the Anatomical Snuffbox.","Background/Objectives: The distal transradial approach (dTRA) is increasingly used in interventional cardiology. Doppler Ultrasound (DUS) effectively assesses radial artery (RA) characteristics. This study aims to identify specific RA DUS characteristics in patients undergoing coronary procedures via dTRA. Methods: Participants from the ANTARES trial who completed the intervention per-protocol and retained RA patency were included. DUS was performed at baseline, 1 day, and 60 days post-procedure. Results: Among 400 participants, 348 had either dTRA (n = 169) or conventional transradial access (cTRA) (n = 179). Distal RA lumen diameter was 12% smaller than that of the proximal RA (p < 0.001). Men had a 14% larger distal RA diameter than women (2.33 ± 0.31 mm vs. 2.04 ± 0.27 mm, p < 0.0001), similar to the proximal RA relationship. Peak flow velocities were similar between the sexes. Univariate linear regression showed that height, weight, body mass index, and body surface area (BSA) predicted arterial size, with BSA remaining significant in multivariate analysis (beta coefficient 0.62; confidence interval 0.49-0.75; p < 0.0001). Distal RA diameter correlated positively with palpable pulse at the snuffbox and wrist. The dTRA resulted in an immediate 14% and 11% increase in distal and proximal RA diameter, respectively (both p < 0.05). Sixty days after dTRA, the distal RA remained slightly dilated (p < 0.05), while the proximal RA returned to baseline. Conclusions: Distal RA diameter is significantly associated with sex, measuring smaller than the forearm segment. A strong palpable pulse correlates with larger distal RA size. The dTRA induces RA lumen expansion. A thorough understanding of distal RA anatomy is essential for optimizing patient selection and refining techniques for transradial procedures.","Łukasz Koziński, Zbigniew Orzałkiewicz, Paweł Zagożdżon, Alicja Dąbrowska-Kugacka","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep20",NA
"39335757","Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Disorders in Adults with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 3.","Spinal muscular atrophy type 3 (juvenile SMA, Kugelberg-Welander disease) is a genetic disease caused by changes in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN) gene. However, there is increasing evidence of metabolic abnormalities in SMA patients, such as altered fatty acid metabolism, impaired glucose tolerance, and defects in the functioning of muscle mitochondria. Given that data in the literature are scarce regarding this subject, the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in adult patients with SMA type 3. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 23 adult patients with SMA type 3 who underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including a physical examination, biochemical analysis, and an oral glucose tolerance test during 2020-2023. At least one lipid abnormality was observed in 60.8% of patients. All four lipid parameters were atypical in 4.3% of patients, three lipid parameters were abnormal in 21.7% of patients, and two lipid parameters were altered in 8.7% patients. A total of 91.3% of SMA3 patients met the HOMA-IR criteria for insulin resistance, with 30.43% having impaired glucose tolerance. None of the patients met the criteria for a diagnosis of overt DM2. The prevalence of dyslipidemia and altered glucose metabolism in our study sets apart the adult population with SMA3 from the general population, confirming a significant interplay between muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Ensuring metabolic care for aging patients with SMA 3 is crucial, as they are vulnerable to metabolic derangements and cardiovascular risks.","Marija Miletić, Zorica Stević, Svetlana Vujović, Jelena Rakočević, Ana Tomić, Milina Tančić Gajić, Miloš Stojanović, Aleksa Palibrk, Miloš Žarković","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep19",NA

This study aims to analyze the association of fecal microbiota composition, body composition, and lipid characteristics in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). In our cross-sectional study, patients with CD were enrolled and blood and fecal samples were collected. Clinical and endoscopic disease activity and body composition were assessed and laboratory tests were made. Fecal bacterial composition was analyzed using the shotgun method. Microbiota alterations based on obesity, lipid parameters, and disease characteristics were analyzed. In this study, 27 patients with CD were analyzed, of which 37.0% were obese based on visceral fat area (VFA). Beta diversities were higher in non-obese patients (p < 0.001), but relative abundances did not differ. C. innocuum had a higher abundance at a high cholesterol level than Bacillota (p = 0.001, p = 0.0034). Adlercreutzia, B. longum, and Blautia alterations were correlated with triglyceride levels. Higher Clostridia (p = 0.009) and B. schinkii (p = 0.032) and lower Lactobacillus (p = 0.035) were connected to high VFA. Disease activity was coupled with dysbiotic elements.

Therefore, within this study, the mortality risk post-acute COVID-19 in the CRIT-COV-U cohort was investigated. Survival data from 651 patients that survived an acute phase of COVID-19 were retrieved and the association between urinary peptides and future death was assessed. Data spanning until December 2023 were collected from six countries, comparing mortality trends with age- and sex-matched COVID-19-negative controls. A death prediction classifier was developed and validated using pre-existing urinary peptidomic datasets. Notably, 13.98% of post-COVID-19 patients succumbed during the follow-up, with mortality rates significantly higher than COVID-19-negative controls, particularly evident in younger individuals (<65 years). These data for the first time demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection highly significantly increases the risk of mortality not only during the acute phase of the disease but also beyond for a period of about one year. In our study, we were further able to identify 201 urinary peptides linked to mortality. These peptides are fragments of albumin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, beta-2-microglobulin, CD99 antigen, various collagens, fibrinogen alpha, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, and uromodulin and were integrated these into a predictive classifier (DP201). Higher DP201 scores, alongside age and BMI, significantly predicted death. The peptide-based classifier demonstrated significant predictive value for mortality in post-acute COVID-19 patients, highlighting the utility of urinary peptides in prognosticating post-acute COVID-19 mortality, offering insights for targeted interventions. By utilizing these defined biomarkers in the clinic, risk stratification, monitoring, and personalized interventions can be significantly improved. Our data also suggest that mortality should be considered as one possible symptom or a consequence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a fact that is currently overlooked.","Justyna Siwy, Felix Keller, Mirosław Banasik, Björn Peters, Emmanuel Dudoignon, Alexandre Mebazaa, Dilara Gülmez, Goce Spasovski, Mercedes Salgueira Lazo, Marek W Rajzer, Łukasz Fuławka, Magdalena Dzitkowska-Zabielska, Harald Mischak, Manfred Hecking, Joachim Beige, Ralph Wendt, NA UriCoV Working Group","Biomedicines","2024Sep13",NA
"39335565","Platelet and Lymphocyte-Related Parameters as Potential Markers of Osteoarthritis Severity: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Platelets and lymphocytes levels are important in assessing systemic disorders, reflecting inflammatory and immune responses. This study investigated the relationship between blood parameters (platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), lymphocyte count (LINF), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR)) and osteoarthritis (OA) severity, considering age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Patients aged ≥40 years were included in this cross-sectional study and divided into groups based on knee OA severity using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. A logistic regression model, adjusted for confounders, evaluated the ability of PLT, MPV, LINF, and PLR to categorize OA severity. Model performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was assessed using ROC curves. The study involved 245 OA patients (51.4% female, 48.6% male) aged 40-90 years, 35.9% with early OA (KL < 3) and 64.1% moderate/severe OA (KL ≥ 3). Most patients (60.8%) were aged ≥60 years, and BMI was <25 kg/m2 in 33.9%. The model showed that a 25-unit increase in PLR elevates the odds of higher OA levels by 1.30 times (1-unit OR = 1.011, 95% CI [1.004, 1.017], p < 0.005), while being ≥40 years old elevates the odds by 4.42 times (OR 4.42, 95% CI [2.46, 7.95], p < 0.0005). The model's accuracy was 73.1%, with 84% sensitivity, 52% specificity, and an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI [0.675, 0.805]). Higher PLR increases the likelihood of moderate/severe OA, suggesting that monitoring these biomarkers could aid in early detection and management of OA severity. Further research is warranted to cross-validate these results in larger populations.","Francesca Salamanna, Stefania Pagani, Giuseppe Filardo, Deyanira Contartese, Angelo Boffa, Lucia Angelelli, Melania Maglio, Milena Fini, Stefano Zaffagnini, Gianluca Giavaresi","Biomedicines","2024Sep10",NA
"39335526","Glucose Variability in People with Type 1 Diabetes: Associations with Body Weight, Body Composition, and Insulin Sensitivity.","The prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the impact of fat accumulation on glucose dynamics in T1D is poorly understood. We assessed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters in patients with T1D depending on their body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. In 547 patients, including 238 overweight/obese individuals, CGM-derived time in range (TIR) and glucose variability (GV) were estimated. Body composition was assessed by DXA. Estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) was used as an indicator of insulin sensitivity. Overweight/obese patients, when compared to normal-weight ones, have a lower time below range (TBR) (<3 mmol/L), GV, and experienced fewer episodes of low glucose. In men, lower TIR, higher time above range (TAR), and GV reduction were associated with central adiposity assessed by total, trunk, and android fat mass. In women, gynoid fat mass only was associated with a lower TIR and higher TAR. The eGDR was a positive predictor of TIR and a negative predictor of TAR, TBR, and GV in men and women. In conclusion, adiposity in people with T1D is associated with a lower risk of CGM-confirmed hypoglycemia, higher TAR, and reduced GV. These features of daily glucose dynamics may be mediated by insulin resistance.","Julia F Semenova, Anton Yu Yushin, Anton I Korbut, Vadim V Klimontov","Biomedicines","2024Sep03",NA
"39335503","Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Populations in a Suburb of the Largest City in Western Romania.","Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major public health issue worldwide, disproportionately affecting socioeconomically disadvantaged populations due to the social determinants of health (SDOHs). In Western Romania, these populations are particularly vulnerable to CVD. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and impact of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals in Western Romania and identify the primary CVRFs contributing to the high incidence of CVD within this population. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational design was employed, utilizing data from the medical records of 1433 eligible individuals. The inclusion criteria were based on Eurostat's EU-SILC benchmarks, focusing on severe material deprivation, at-risk-of-poverty rates, and low work intensity. Data on demographics, familial and personal medical history, smoking status, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c levels were collected. Results: Of the 1433 subjects, 34.75% were male, with a median age of 52 years. Significant conditions included diabetes (7.39%), coronary disease (3.83%), arterial hypertension (35.58%), and dyslipidemia (21.28%). Median ages were higher for those with diabetes (65 vs. 51 years, p < 0.0001), coronary disease (64 vs. 51 years, p < 0.0001), arterial hypertension (65 vs. 43 years, p < 0.0001), and dyslipidemia (66 vs. 47 years, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: The findings highlight the significant prevalence of CVRFs among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations in Western Romania. Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations exhibit a significantly higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, impaired glucose regulation, hypertension, and dyslipidemia compared to their before known status.","Andreea Dumitrescu, Gabriela Mut Vitcu, Svetlana Stoica, Septimiu Radu Susa, Emil Robert Stoicescu","Biomedicines","2024Sep02",NA
"39335476","The Role of Body Mass Index (BMI) in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Potential Prognostic Factor?","Obesity has been recognized as a potential risk factor for the carcinogenesis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The aim of this observational study was to investigate the prognostic role of BMI in influencing DTC histopathological aggressiveness and the risk of tumor relapse. We enrolled 257 patients with DTC, consecutively admitted to our Institution between January 2016 and December 2023. The following variables were collected: demographic, anthropometric and clinical parameters, risk factors for DTC, surgical and radioiodine therapy, histopathological features of DTC, and biochemical markers of disease. Tumor recurrence was assessed during short-, medium- and long-term follow-up. According to BMI tertiles (e.g; I: BMI < 23.3 kg/m2; II: 23.3 ≤ BMI < 27.1 kg/m2; III: BMI ≥ 27.1 kg/m2), the clinical and histopathological characteristics did not differ between groups. The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that BMI was not associated with clinical and histopathological aggressiveness of DTC, independently from sex, age, and risk factors for DTC onset. Moreover, BMI did not constitute a predictor of tumor recurrence during follow-up. In conclusion, BMI does not represent a predictor of clinical and histopathological aggressiveness of DTC. Since it is not a reliable marker of adiposity, BMI cannot be considered alone in evaluating the potential association between obesity and DTC prognosis.","Chiara Mele, Lucrezia De Marchi, Giulia Marsan, Marco Zavattaro, Maria Grazia Mauri, Paolo Aluffi Valletti, Gianluca Aimaretti, Paolo Marzullo","Biomedicines","2024Aug29",NA
"39334889","Oxidative Stress and Asprosin Levels in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Good and Poor Glycemic Control.","Objectives: HbA1c is the most widely used test as an indicator of glucoregulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Asprosin and oxidative stress levels can be reduced with good glycemic control (GC) and thus prevented or delayed micro/macro complications in patients with T2DM. The relationship between asprosin, which is thought to affect GC, and oxidative stress parameters such as lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was evaluated in T2DM patients. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted prospectively in 75 healthy people admitted to the hospital for a general health check-up and 150 T2DM patients treated in the diabetes outpatient clinic. The patient's glycemic status measurements were categorized as good glycemic control group (GGC) is defined as HbA1c < 7 and poor glycemic control (PGC) group is defined as HbA1c ≥ 7. Results: The study found a consistent increase in LOOH and MDA levels across the control, GGC, and PGC groups, while GSH, Cu/Zn-SOD, and TAC levels decreased in these respective groups. Additionally, asprosin levels showed a gradual rise in all groups. Positive correlations were observed between asprosin levels and various metabolic and oxidative stress markers, including BMI, WC, FBG, insulin, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), DM duration, LOOH, and MDA, while negative correlations were noted with GSH, Cu/Zn-SOD, and TAC specifically in the PGC group. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis identified HOMA-IR as the primary influencing factor on asprosin levels in PGC patients. Conclusions: Current glycemic dysregulation may lead to increased circulating asprosin and oxidative stress, which cause complications. Since asprosin levels may be an important hormonal factor in determining GC in T2DM, the use of this hormone may be recommended in the future to accelerate therapeutic approaches in T2DM. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may delay the development and progression of diabetic complications.","Abdulhalim Senyigit, Sinem Durmus, Remise Gelisgen, Hafize Uzun","Biomolecules","2024Sep05","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Oxidative Stress; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Fibrillin-1; Glycated Hemoglobin; Glycemic Control; Blood Glucose; Glutathione; Adult; Malondialdehyde; Aged; Prospective Studies; Biomarkers; Antioxidants; Superoxide Dismutase; Adipokines"
"39334717","Sodium Houttuybonate Promotes the Browning of White Adipose Tissue by Inhibiting Ferroptosis via the AMPK-NRF2-HO1 Pathway.","The rising prevalence of obesity has resulted in an increased demand for innovative and effective treatment strategies. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (H. cordata) has demonstrated promising potential in preventing obesity. However, the mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effects of H. cordata and its bioactive component, sodium houttuybonate (SH), remains unclear. Our study reveals that SH treatment promotes the browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and prevents the obesity induced by a high-fat diet. SH significantly mitigates ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, while also enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Furthermore, SH promotes the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which subsequently increases the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the iWAT. However, the effects of SH were attenuated by ML385, an Nrf2 inhibitor. Collectively, our findings suggest that SH induces iWAT browning and prevents diet-induced obesity primarily through the AMPK/NRF2/HO-1 pathway by inhibiting ferroptosis.","Wenhui Liu, Huren Zou, Danming You, Huijie Zhang, Lingling Xu","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Aug30",NA

In this study, the influence of common and rare PON variants on both conditions was investigated. A total of 507 healthy weight individuals and 744 patients with obesity including 433 with histological liver assessment, were sequenced with single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), allowing the identification of genetic contributions to obesity and MASLD-related liver features. Polymorphisms rs705379 and rs854552 in the PON1 gene displayed significant association with MASLD stage and fibrosis, respectively. Additionally, rare PON1 variants were strongly associated with obesity. This study thereby reinforces the genetic foundation of PON1 in obesity and various MASLD-related liver features, by extending previous findings from common variants to include rare variants. Additionally, rare and very rare variants in PON2 were discovered to be associated with MASLD-related hepatic fibrosis. Notably, we are the first to report an association between naturally occurring rare PON2 variants and MASLD-related liver fibrosis.

The aim of the study was to determine their association with common risk factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined 300 children attending elementary schools. After taking their height and weight, their body mass indices (BMIs) were calculated. Oral examination was performed to record the decayed, missed, and filled scores (dmft/DMFT). A thorough questionnaire was compiled and validated to gather information on diet and physical activity (PA). The KIDMED score was calculated from a 16-item questionnaire to assess diet. Junk food and PA scores were also calculated based on relevant questions. Nonparametric tests were used to assess the associations between the scores and health outcomes (dmft/DMFT and BMI). Results: Fifty-eight of the children had poor diets, which was associated with higher dmft/DMFT (p = 0.012). PA levels were very low, and the average PA score was 2.12 ± 0.61. No association was found between BMI percentiles and PA level, nor between BMI percentiles and diet quality. Older children had lower BMI percentiles compared with younger children (coefficient = -9.35, 95% CI: -17.05, -1.65), and a borderline significant negative association was observed between dmft/DMFT and BMI percentile.

Most MC research has focused on children's age, with fewer studies examining separate associations between MC and biological maturation. This cross-sectional study used network analysis to assess the nonlinear associations between biological maturation (the child's percentage of predicted mature stature to indicate somatic maturation), chronological age, sex, BMI, and MC (Test of Gross Motor Development, third edition) in 218 children (100 boys, 118 girls) aged 7-9 years. Biological maturation was not significantly associated with MC in boys and weakly associated with MC in girls for the dribble, under-hand throw, and gallop. Age was positively associated with MC in girls and boys. Centrality measures indicated that the gallop and slide in girls and the dribble, catch, and run in boys were the most important network variables. Positive associations were observed between maturation and BMI for girls (r = 0.579) and, to a lesser degree, for boys (r = 0.267). The findings suggest that age, rather than biological maturation, is positively associated with MC in 7- to 9-year-olds.

Among diet-related risk factors of OV/OB risk and MUO, meal patterns remain limitedly studied. The aim of this systematic review was to explore associations between meal patterns and the risk of childhood OV/OB and MUO in children/adolescents aged 2-19 years. Longitudinal studies and randomised controlled trials from PUBMED and Scopus published between January 2013 and April 2024 were retrieved. Twenty-eight studies were included, all of which reported on OV/OB risk, with none on MUO risk. Regular consumption of breakfast (n = 3) and family meals (n = 4) and avoiding dining while watching TV (n = 4) may be protective factors against childhood OV/OB, whereas meal skipping (primarily breakfast; n = 4) may be a detrimental factor. Mixed effects of meal frequency on OV/OB risk were observed; no effects of frequency of lunch or of fast-food consumption and of meals served at school were found. There was insufficient evidence to support the role of other patterns (meal timing, eating in other social contexts). Meals were mainly participant-identified, leading to increased heterogeneity. Research focusing on childhood MUO and the use of harmonised definitions regarding the assessment of meal patterns are highly warranted.","Georgios Saltaouras, Athanasia Kyrkili, Eirini Bathrellou, Michael Georgoulis, Mary Yannakoulia, Vasiliki Bountziouka, Urška Smrke, George Dimitrakopoulos, Meropi D Kontogianni","Children (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep07",NA

Methods: Using cluster sampling, we recruited a national sample of 6-12-year-old children in Switzerland (n = 1245). We conducted anthropometric measurements and assessed risk factors using a self-administered questionnaire. We investigated the time trend by including data from four comparable previous surveys conducted since 2002. Results: We found a prevalence of overweight, including obesity, of 16.1 (14.1-18.2)%, with a significantly higher proportion in boys (18.6 (15.5-21.6)%) compared to girls (13.7 (11.0-16.4)%). We found a small but significant reduction in the prevalence of overweight including obesity over time (p = 0.005), but not of obesity alone (p = 0.099). The most important risk factors for obesity were parental education, parental origin, media consumption, as well as several dietary factors. Conclusions: Despite a slight decreasing trend in childhood overweight in Switzerland, it remains a public health concern.

This case-control study included 77 CD patients aged 3-18 years diagnosed with CD using IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase and duodenal biopsy and 33 healthy controls. Nutritional status was evaluated based on demographic and clinical characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical parameters. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association between CD and growth stunting. Approximately one-third (31%) of children with CD had stunted growth, 20.8% had a low body mass index for their age, and 5.2% had both growth stunting and wasting. Children with CD had higher odds of iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, and lower socioeconomic status. They were also younger and had decreased serum levels of vitamin D compared to the controls. These factors were all significantly associated with an increased risk of CD, collectively explaining over 50% of the risk. For growth stunting, lower education status among mothers, family income, and serum ferritin were identified as risk factors. A significant proportion of children and adolescents with CD had malnutrition, overt deficiencies, and impaired growth despite coherence with a gluten-free diet. Routine monitoring and targeted nutritional interventions are recommended for children and adolescents with CD to address malnutrition and growth stunting.

A total of 1016 nails were analyzed (517 from patients with psoriatic arthritis and 499 from controls). Ultrasonography of the nails of the 10 fingers was performed to assess the trilaminar appearance, measure the distance from the nail bed, identify synovitis of the distal interphalangeal joints and the presence of a power Doppler signal from the nail matrix/nail bed. The captured images were independently evaluated by a rheumatologist with expertise in musculoskeletal ultrasound. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v.28.0.0 software, and the association of nail plate changes, nail bed distance and power Doppler signal with the NAPSI, DAPSA, MDA and ASDAS-PCR were calculated. Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated to analyze the correlations between pairs of quantitative variables. Student's t test and the Mann‒Whitney U test were used to compare quantitative variables, and Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between patients and controls. The nonparametric Mann‒Whitney U and Kruskal‒Wallis tests were used to compare groups according to the MDA or DAPSA classification. The Doppler signal of the nail matrix and nail bed was more frequently identified in patients (44.2%) than in controls (6%), and the difference in the mean power Doppler signal between the two groups was significant (p < 0.001). Changes in the nail plate were more common in the right thumb (44.2%), left thumb (36.5%) and second finger on the right hand (32.7%). The number of fingers with nail plate changes, enthesitis, paratendinitis, grayscale synovitis and DIP involvement in the distal interphalangeal joints was higher among patients with psoriatic arthritis (p < 0.001). There were found some correlations between US findings and clinical scores: ultrasound nail involvement and the NAPSI score (p = 0.034), the number of fingers and mean change in the nail plate and the ASDAS-CRP (p = 0.030). DAPSA (remission/low activity versus moderate/high activity) was associated to the mean change in the nail plate (p < 0.013). Nail ultrasound has the potential to assist in the capturing of the actual disease activity status in patients with psoriatic arthritis.","Andrieli Caroline Mehl, Leonardo Michaelis Schmidt, Valderílio Feijó Azevedo","Advances in rheumatology (London, England)","2024Sep27","Humans; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Nails; Cross-Sectional Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Nail Diseases; Case-Control Studies"
"39334464","Adipose-derived stem cells apoptosis rejuvenate radiation-impaired skin in mice via remodeling and rearranging dermal collagens matrix.","Chronic radiation dermatitis (CRD) is a late consequence of radiation with high incidence in patients receiving radiotherapy. Conventional therapies often yield unsatisfactory results. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential and mechanism of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for CRD, paving the way for novel regenerative therapies in clinical practice. Clinical CRD skin biopsies were analyzed to character the pathological changes of CRD skin and guided the animal modeling scheme. Subsequently, an in vivo analysisusing mouse CRD models was conducted to explore their effects of ADSCs on CRD, monitoring therapeutic impact for up to 8 weeks. Transcriptome sequencing and histologic sections analysis were performed to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of ADSCs. Following observing extensive apoptosis of transplanted ADSCs, the therapeutic effect of ADSCs were compared with those of apoptosis-inhibited ADSCs. Multiphoton imaging and analysis of collagen morphologic features were employed to explain how translated ADSCs promote collagen remodeling at the microscopic level based on the contrast of morphology of collagen fibers. Following injection into CRD-afflicted skin, ADSCs therapy effectively mitigated symptoms of CRD, including acanthosis of the epidermis, fibrosis, and irregular collagen deposition, consistent with the possible therapeutic mechanism suggested by transcriptome sequencing. Notably, in vivo tracking revealed a significant reduction in ADSCs number due to extensive apoptosis. Inhibiting apoptosis in ADSCs partially tempered their therapeutic effects. Mechanically, analysis of collagen morphologic features indicated that translated ADSCs might promote dermal extracellular matrix remodeling through enlarging, lengthening, crimping, and evening collagen, counteracting the atrophy and rupture caused by irradiation. This study demonstrated that ADSCs underwent substantial apoptosis upon local skin transplantation, and paradoxically, this apoptosis is essential for their efficacy in promoting the regeneration of late radiation-impaired skin. Mechanically, transplanted ADSCs could promote the remodeling and rearrangement of radiation-damaged dermal collagen matrix.","Yufan Zhu, Xu Liu, Xihang Chen, Yunjun Liao","Stem cell research & therapy","2024Sep27","Animals; Mice; Apoptosis; Collagen; Adipose Tissue; Skin; Stem Cells; Radiodermatitis; Humans; Mice, Inbred C57BL"

The evidence about joint effect of DHA intake and tobacco smoke exposure on children and adolescents' learning disabilities (LD) was limited. The objective of this study was to assess the joint effect of DHA intake and tobacco smoke exposure on children and adolescents' LD. A cross-sectional analysis of the NHANES 1999-2004 was performed. Children and adolescents aged 6-15 years old were included. The outcome was diagnosed by parental report of ever health professionals or school representative-identified LD. Dietary DHA intake data were obtained by food frequency questionnaire and tobacco smoke exposure levels were evaluated by serum cotinine levels. Weighted univariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the joint effect of DHA intake and tobacco smoke exposure on LD in children and adolescents, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This joint association was further assessed after stratification by age, gender, body mass index, the history of attention deficit disorder and seen mental health professional. We identified 5,247 children and adolescents in present study, of whom 593 (11.30%) had LD. After adjusting covariates, we observed children and adolescents with DHA intake (OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.61-0.96) was related to lower incidence of LD; children who exposure to tobacco smoke was related to higher incidence of LD (OR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.07-2.23); children and adolescents who exposure to tobacco smoke and without DHA intake were related to highest odds of LD (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 1.37-3.17, P for trend = 0.042), that was, DHA and tobacco smoke exposure may have a joint effect on the odds of LD in children and adolescents. Subgroup analyses suggested this joint effect was robust especially among children and adolescents with normal & underweight BMI and without the history of attention deficit disorder and seen mental health professional. Increasing the DHA intake and reducing tobacco smoke exposure may have a potential role in the prevention of LD in children and adolescents. This joint effect warrants further investigation by large-scale prospective study.","Ling Liu, Xiuli Shu, Zijun Xu, Haibo Jiang","Italian journal of pediatrics","2024Sep27","Humans; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Male; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Nutrition Surveys; Learning Disabilities; United States"

However, the majority of studies focus on egg intake, and there is a limitation in the availability of prospective cohort studies. Our study examined the association between dietary cholesterol and the incidence risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in middle aged adults using large prospective cohort study in Republic of Korea. The Health Examinees cohort from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study was used from baseline to follow-up. Dietary cholesterol intake was assessed by the validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Participants were classified as quintile groups according to adjusted dietary cholesterol for total energy intake. MetS was defined as more than 3 of the 5 components of MetS. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for MetS were evaluated by multivariable cox regression analyses. Of the total 40,578 participants, metabolic syndrome developed in 4,172 (10.28%) individuals during an average follow-up period of approximately 4.76 years. Dietary cholesterol did not exhibit a significant association with the risk of MetS after adjusting for potential confounding factors, but a trend was observed indicating an increased risk with higher intake (p for trend = 0.044). Among the components of MetS, the incidence risk of high waist circumference (HR: 1.164, 95% CI: 1.049-1.290), high blood pressure (HR: 1.188, 95% CI: 1.075-1.313), high serum triglyceride (HR: 1.132, 95% CI: 1.044-1.227) and high fasting blood glucose (HR: 1.217, 95% CI: 1.132-1.308) in the group that consumed the highest dietary cholesterol intake was increased compared with the group that consumed the lowest dietary cholesterol intake. Dose-response relationship suggested a positive linear association between dietary cholesterol intake and the risk of high waist circumference (p-linearity = 0.004), blood pressure (p-linearity = 0.012), and triglycerides (p-linearity = 0.005).

This study aims to elucidate the association between LAP and VAI and the prevalence of migraine. Data for this study were sourced from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A database-self-administered questionnaire was used to assess severe headache or migraine. A weighted logistic regression model was employed to assess the relationship between LAP and VAI with migraine prevalence. Complementary analytical approaches included subgroup analysis, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and threshold effect analysis to validate the findings. In the end, 4572 people were recruited for the research, including 880 with migraine and 3692 without migraine. Following adjustment for the relevant covariables, weighted logistic regression analysis (OR = 1.409, 95% CI: 1.054, 1.883, P = 0.022; OR = 1.288, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.642, P = 0.042) revealed significantly elevated odds of migraine prevalence in participants within the highest tertile (T3) of LAP and VAI than those in the lowest tertile (T1). The nonlinear association between migraine prevalence and both VAI and LAP was further elucidated through a restricted cubic spline. The threshold analysis pinpointed 2.142 (log-likelihood ratio = 0.016) as the critical inflection point for VAI. Subgroup analysis and interaction testing revealed the significant association was independent in different subgroup factors.

"39334357","The mediating effect of TyG-related indicators between long-term exposure to particulate matter and cardiovascular disease: evidence from a national longitudinal cohort study.","Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure is recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the extent to which PM exposure is associated with CVD via triglyceride glucose (TyG)-related indicators remains unknown. This study examines the relationship between long-term PM exposure and CVD events, further assessing whether TyG-related indicators mediate this association. This cohort study involved 7,532 individuals aged at least 45 years who were not diagnosed with CVD in 2011 from the China Longitudinal Study of Health and Retirement (CHARLS) and were followed up for the occurrence of CVD until 2020. The annual PM concentration data at the city level, with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 1 μm (PM1), ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and ≤ 10 μm (PM10), were obtained from the ChinaHighAirPollutants (CHAP). The average concentration of PM in the 3 years before the baseline survey in 2011 was defined as the long-term exposure level of the individual. The relationship between PM exposure and CVD incidence was examined via Cox proportional hazards models, with a focus on probing the role of TyG-related indicators through mediation analysis. A total of 1,865 individuals with CVD were diagnosed over the span of a 7.4-year follow-up period. The 3-year average concentrations before baseline were 31.29 µg/m³ for PM1, 56.03 µg/m³ for PM2.5, and 95.73 µg/m³ for PM10. In fully adjusted model, the Cox proportional hazards models revealed that an increase of 10 µg/m³ in the PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 exposure concentrations corresponded to elevated CVD risk, with HRs (95% CI) of 1.135 (1.078-1.195), 1.092 (1.062-1.123), and 1.075 (1.059-1.090), respectively. Mediation analyses further suggested that the correlation between PM exposure and CVD could be partly mediated via TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR, with mediation proportions varying from 5.54 to 15.30%. A significant correlation was observed between long-term PM exposure and increased CVD risk, with TyG-related indicators, such as TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR, partially mediating this relationship.","Jiamin Xu, Tongle Yin, Mengshan Pan, Li Qin, Lu Zhang, Xiaoyan Wang, Weijun Zheng, Cuiqing Liu, Rucheng Chen","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep27","Humans; Particulate Matter; Cardiovascular Diseases; Male; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Aged; China; Triglycerides; Environmental Exposure; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Blood Glucose; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution"

The study aimed to investigate longitudinal association of epigenome-wide DNAm with liver fat content (LFC) in Chinese participants, and explore their temporal relationships. Data were obtained from 2 waves over a four-year time period of the Shanghai Changfeng Study (discovery, n = 407 and replication, n = 126). LFC and peripheral blood DNAm were repeatedly measured using quantitative hepatic ultrasonography and the 850 K Illumina EPIC BeadChip, respectively. Longitudinal and cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) were conducted with linear mixed model and linear regression model, respectively. Meta-analysis was performed using METAL. Cross-lagged panel analysis (CLPA) was carried out to infer temporal relationships between the significant CpGs and LFC. Longitudinal EWAS identified cg11024682 (SREBF1), cg06500161 (ABCG1), cg16740586 (ABCG1), cg15659943 (ABCA1) and cg00163198 (SNX19) significantly associated with LFC with P < 1e-7. Another 6 of the 22 previously reported CpGs were replicated in the present longitudinal EWAS. CLPA showed longitudinal effects of cg11024682 (SREBF1) (β = 0.14 [0.06, 0.23]), cg16740586 (ABCG1) (β = 0.17 [0.08, 0.25]), cg06500161 (ABCG1) (β = 0.12 [0.03, 0.20]), cg17901584 (DHCR24) (β = -0.10 [-0.18, -0.02]), cg00574958 (CPT1A) (β = -0.09 [-0.17, -0.01]), cg08309687 (LINC00649) (β = -0.11 [-0.19, -0.03]), and cg27243685 (ABCG1) (β = 0.09 [0.01, 0.18]) on subsequent LFC. The effects were attenuated when further adjusting for body mass index. High levels of LFC led to alterations in DNAm of cg15659943 (ABCA1) (β = 0.13 [0.04, 0.21]), cg07162647 (β = -0.11 [-0.19, -0.03]), cg06500161 (ABCG1) (β = 0.10 [0.02, 0.18]), and cg27243685 (ABCG1) (β = 0.10 [0.02, 0.18]). Blood DNAm at SREBF1, ABCG1, DHCR24, CPT1A, and LINC00649 may be predictors of subsequent LFC change. The effects of DNAm at SREBF1 and ABCG1 on LFC were partially influenced by obesity. The findings have potential implications in understanding disease pathogenesis and highlight the potential of DNAm for early detection or intervention of fatty liver.","Hailuan Zeng, Wenran Li, Mingfeng Xia, Jieyu Ge, Hui Ma, Lingyan Chen, Baishen Pan, Huandong Lin, Sijia Wang, Xin Gao","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep27","Humans; DNA Methylation; Male; Middle Aged; Liver; Female; Biomarkers; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1; Genome-Wide Association Study; Cross-Sectional Studies; CpG Islands; Epigenesis, Genetic; Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1"

This research seeks to clarify the association between the CUN-BAE Index and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) from a gender perspective. The study utilized data from a comprehensive health assessment initiative known as ""Human Dock"", involving 14,251 participants. MASLD was diagnosed using abdominal ultrasound, primarily evaluated based on the following sonographic features: hepatorenal echo contrast, vascular blurring, deep attenuation, liver brightness. First, we evaluated the association of MASLD with the CUN-BAE Index using multivariate logistic regression. Second, we visualized this association and estimated potential threshold effect points using the restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression model. Ultimately, we evaluated the ability of the CUN-BAE Index to detect MASLD through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The female-to-male ratio was 1:1.08, with a MASLD prevalence rate of 17.59%. Following the adjustment for confounding variables, an increase of one unit in the CUN-BAE Index corresponded to a 14% increase in the risk of MASLD for males and an 18% increase for females. RCS analysis revealed an S-shaped relationship between MASLD prevalence and the CUN-BAE Index for both genders, with potential threshold effect points at approximately 30 in females and 15 in males. Beyond these threshold points, the prevalence of MASLD increased rapidly. Further subgroup analyses indicated significant differences in the relationship of the CUN-BAE Index with MASLD within age and body mass index (BMI) subgroups in females, with a stronger association observed in younger and non-obese female participants. Additionally, ROC analysis revealed that the CUN-BAE Index possesses a strong ability to distinguish MASLD in both genders, especially in females. This research is the first to identify a positive relationship between the CUN-BAE Index and MASLD. The CUN-BAE Index appears to be more suitable for early screening of MASLD in females.","Chao Wang, Xin Huang, Shiming He, Maobin Kuang, Guobo Xie, Guotai Sheng, Yang Zou","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep27","Humans; Male; Female; Adiposity; Middle Aged; Adult; Fatty Liver; ROC Curve; Body Mass Index; Ultrasonography; Sex Factors; Aged"

This study aimed to develop a preoperative risk model that utilizes demographic factors and transvaginal ultrasonography of the endometrium to assess and predict the risk of malignancy in females with endometrial cancer. In this retrospective study, a logistic regression model was developed to predict endometrial carcinoma using data from 356 postmenopausal women with endometrial lesions and an endometrial thickness (ET) of 5 mm or more. These patients had undergone transvaginal ultrasonography prior to surgery, with findings including 247 benign and 109 malignant cases. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared with post-surgical pathological diagnoses. Our model incorporates several predictors for endometrial carcinoma, including age, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), duration of vaginal bleeding, endometrial thickness, completeness of the endometrial line, and endometrial vascularization. It demonstrated a strong prediction with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 (95% CI, 0.865-0.945). At the optimal risk threshold of 0.33, the model achieved a sensitivity of 82.18% and a specificity of 92.80%.

The body fat anthropometric indices included the a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), cardiometabolic index (CMI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), waist triglyceride index (WTI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and triglyceride‒glucose (TyG) index. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) criteria. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Index through December 31, 2019. Data were collected from 8,379 individuals with MetS, with a median follow-up of 8.5 years, of whom 1,698 died from all causes and 568 from the CCD. The random survival forest (RSF) analysis indicated that the ABSI had the strongest predictive power for both all-cause mortality and CCD mortality among the eight body fat AIs. After adjusting for multiple variables, the ABSI was found to be linearly and positively associated with all-cause and CCD mortality in individuals with MetS. Participants in the highest quartile of ABSI had an increased risk of all-cause (HR = 1.773 [1.419-2.215]) and CCD (HR = 1.735 [1.267-2.375]) mortality compared with those in the lowest quartile.

AVAI quartiles showed a pronounced relationship with female infertility risk, with the highest quartile showing the greatest risk(OR = 9.35,95% CI: 2.96-29.55). Nonlinear and threshold effects in the relationship between AVAI and female infertility were identified, with an inflection point at -9.70. Subgroup analyses indicated significant interactions between AVAI and educational status and BMI, particularly in women with a BMI below 25 kg/m2, where a high AVAI level was closely related to increased infertility risk(OR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.44-2.58). The study identifies a strong association between elevated AVAI scores and female infertility risk, especially in women with a BMI under 25 kg/m2. This suggests that AVAI could be a valuable predictor in female fertility assessments.","Mingqin Kuang, Ying Yu, Shanyang He","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep27","Humans; Female; Adult; Infertility, Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Body Mass Index; Adiposity; Nutrition Surveys; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Obesity, Abdominal; Risk Factors; Waist Circumference; Age Factors"
"39334141","Development and external validation of clinical predictive model for stress urinary incontinence in Chinese women : a multicenter retrospective study.","Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the prevalent form of urinary incontinence, significantly impairs women's quality of life. This study aims to create a visual nomogram to estimate the risk of SUI within one year postpartum for early intervention in high-risk Chinese women. We recruited 1,531 postpartum women who gave birth at two hospitals in Kunshan City from 2021 to 2022. Delivery details were meticulously extracted from the hospitals' medical records system, while one-year postpartum follow-ups were conducted via phone surveys specifically designed to ascertain SUI status. Utilizing data from one hospital as the training set, logistic regression analysis was performed to pinpoint significant factors and subsequently construct the nomogram. To ensure robustness, an independent dataset sourced from the second hospital served as the external validation cohort. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using calibration plots, ROC curves, AUC values, and DCA curves. The study population was 1,125 women. The SUI incidence within one year postpartum was 26% (293/1125). According to the regression analysis, height, pre-pregnancy BMI, method of induction, mode of delivery, perineal condition, neonatal weight, SUI during pregnancy, and SUI during the first pregnancy were incorporated into the nomogram. The AUC of the nomogram was 0.829 (95% CI 0.790-0.867), and the external validation set was 0.746 (95% CI 0.689-0.804). Subgroup analysis based on parity showed good discrimination. The calibration curve indicated concordance. The DCA curve showed a significant net benefit. Drawing from real-world data, we have successfully developed an SUI predictive model tailored for postpartum Chinese women. Upon successful external validation, this model holds immense potential as an effective screening tool for SUI, enabling timely interventions and ultimately may improve women's quality of life.","Dan Zhang, Min Zhou, Mingya Zhang, Youfang Zhang, Donghui Wu, Ruijuan Weng, Min Tang, Zvikomborero Panashe Rejoice Munemo, Hongxiu Zhang","BMC women's health","2024Sep27","Humans; Female; Urinary Incontinence, Stress; Adult; Retrospective Studies; China; Nomograms; Pregnancy; Postpartum Period; Risk Factors; Incidence; Risk Assessment; Quality of Life; East Asian People"
"39334106","A web-based and mobile randomised controlled trial providing complementary feeding guidelines to first-time parents in France to promote responsive parental feeding practices, healthy children's eating behaviour and optimal body mass index: the NutrienT trial study protocol.","Childhood obesity is a crucial public health issue. Early childhood is a critical time to foster the establishment of healthy eating behaviours and growth, which are partly shaped by parental feeding practices. To inform French parents of the recently updated national complementary feeding guidelines for 0-3 years (in terms of nutrition and responsive feeding as a mean to encourage infant appetite control skills and promote healthy growth), an official printed brochure was developed and nationally disseminated in 2021 by the French public health agency, Santé publique France. This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether the provision of guidelines through digital (smartphone application) and printed (brochure) tools (vs. the printed brochure alone, usual service) results in healthier parental feeding practices, infant eating behaviours and weight status. This double-blinded monocentric 2-arm trial is currently conducted among first-time parents living in the area of Dijon (France) and recruited in a maternity ward. From child age 3 to 36 months (mo), an app provides a range of 106 age-adapted messages, including dietary recommendations, educational advice, recipes, and tips (intervention group only). Additionally, parents of both groups are provided with 48 messages related to child general development and the printed brochure at child age 2.7 mo. The primary outcome is the body mass index (BMI) z-score at child age 36 mo. Secondary outcome measures include a combination of online parents' reports and behavioural assessments (experimental meals) of parental feeding practices and infant eating behaviours from inclusion to 36 months of age. Analyses of covariance on these outcomes will assess the effect of the intervention, adjusted for relevant confounders. Complementary mediation and moderation analyses will be conducted. Sample size was determined to be n = 118 in each arm of the trial, plus 20% to compensate for potential attrition. This is the first public eHealth randomised control trial in France to assess the effect of a web-based and mobile intervention targeted to first-time parents to improve child feeding practices and child growth. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05285761 (March 18, 2022).","Camille Riera-Navarro, Camille Schwartz, Pauline Ducrot, Laurence Noirot, Corinne Delamaire, Edith Sales-Wuillemin, Denis S Semama, Sandrine Lioret, Sophie Nicklaus","BMC public health","2024Sep27","Humans; Infant; France; Child, Preschool; Feeding Behavior; Parents; Body Mass Index; Double-Blind Method; Female; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Mobile Applications; Male; Pediatric Obesity; Nutrition Policy; Pamphlets; Internet-Based Intervention; Health Promotion"
"39334085","Reducing the incidence of overweight and obesity by a healthy lifestyle intervention program for schoolchildren in Hanoi, Vietnam: a randomized controlled trial.","The increasing incidence and prevalence of childhood overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) are major global health challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-year healthy lifestyle intervention program in reducing the incidence of OW and OB among schoolchildren aged 11-12 years in Vietnam. Study design: Randomized controlled trial. In total, 733 students participated in this study. Participants were included from four schools in Hanoi based on a random cluster sampling method. Students' health outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 2 years. The primary outcomes were the incidence of OW and OB, and the secondary outcomes were the prevalence and remission of OW and OB. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to determine the outcomes and risk factors. After the intervention, the prevalence of OW decreased by 9.24% in the intervention group and 3.01% in the control group. After adjustment for age and sex, the odds of overweight were 36.7% lower in the intervention group than in the control group (OR = 0.633; 95% CI: 0.434-0.925; P = 0.018). The incidence of OW was 1.31% in the intervention group compared with 5.33% in the control group. After adjustment for age and sex, the odds of incident overweight in the intervention group were 77.4% lower than in the control group (OR = 0.226; 95% CI: 0.063-0.813; P = 0.023). The proportion of patients who achieved OW remission was 41.22% in the intervention group and 28.68% in the control group. After adjustment for age and sex, the odds of OW remission of overweight were 2.219 times greater in the intervention group than in the control group (OR = 2.219; 95% CI: 1.220-4.036; P = 0.009). For most OB-related factors, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups. A multicomponent healthy lifestyle intervention was effective in reducing the incidence of OW; however, it had no significant effect on OB among children aged 11-12 years in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Observational study based on secondary data from the Hospital Information System. The study universe consisted of 289,005 adult hospitalizations whose primary diagnosis was COVID-19 in five periods from 2020 to 2022. A multilevel regression model was applied, and the death predictive variables were sex, age, Charlson Index, obesity, type of admission, Brazilian Deprivation Index (BrazDep), the month of admission, and hospital size. Then, the total observed deaths and total deaths predicted by the model's fixed effect component were aggregated by each hospital, estimating the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) in each period. Funnel plots with limits of two standard deviations were employed to classify hospitals by performance (higher-than-expected, as expected, and lower-than-expected) and determine whether there was a change in category over the periods. A positive association was observed between hospital mortality and size (number of beds). There was greater variation in the percentage of hospitals with as-expected performance (39.5 to 76.1%) and those with lower-than-expected performance (6.6 to 32.3%). The hospitals with higher-than-expected performance remained at around 30% of the total, except in the fifth period. In the first period, 64 hospitals (18.3%) had lower-than-expected performance, with standardized mortality ratios ranging from 1.2 to 4.4, while in the last period, only 23 (6.6%) hospitals were similarly classified, with ratios ranging from 1.3 to 2.8. A trend of homogenization and adjustment to expected performance was observed over time. Despite the study's limitations, the results suggest an improvement in the COVID-19 inpatient care performance of hospitals reimbursed by the SUS in São Paulo over the period studied, measured by the standardized mortality ratio for hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Moreover, the methodological approach adapted to the Brazilian context provides an applicable tool to follow-up hospital's performance in caring all or specific-cause hospitalizations, in regular or exceptional emergency situations.","Marla Presa Raulino Schilling, Margareth Crisóstomo Portela, Mariana Vercesi de Albuquerque, Mônica Martins","BMC health services research","2024Sep27","Humans; COVID-19; Brazil; Hospital Mortality; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; SARS-CoV-2; National Health Programs; Pandemics; Hospitalization"

This single-center case‒control study analyzed the clinical data of patients with EC and uterine fibroids who underwent surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between October 2018 and October 2023 retrospectively. The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection of our hospital performed PBLs detection using flow cytometry, and recorded the detection results in the electronic medical records system. Between-group and subgroup comparisons of PBLs in patients with EC were analyzed using t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The effect of surgery on PBLs in patients with EC was assessed using a paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The immune function of patients with EC was significantly lower than that of healthy people (P < 0.05) and those with benign uterine diseases (P < 0.05) and was related to body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, and blood lipids (P < 0.05). In patients with EC, the PBLs counts decreased significantly after surgery (P < 0.05) and more kinds of lymphocytes were affected in the laparoscopic surgery group than in the open surgery group. With the decrease of PBLs counts, the immune status of patients with EC is impaired. Metabolic syndrome (Mets), including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high blood lipids, also affects the immune function of patients with EC. And for EC patients, the effect of laparoscopic surgery is greater than that of open surgery. PBLs has the potential to be one of indicator during the diagnosis and treatment of EC. This study was retrospectively registered by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (approval number K2023-578).","Yingyu Tian, Yuchun Zhang, Xi Tang, Jing Liu, Qin Huang, Yi Chen, Qian Zhan, Hui Wang","BMC cancer","2024Sep27","Humans; Female; Endometrial Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Lymphocytes; Case-Control Studies; Retrospective Studies; Adult; Lymphocyte Count; Aged; Flow Cytometry; Leiomyoma; Laparoscopy; Body Mass Index"
"39334024","Overweight and obesity as risk factors for chronic low back pain: a new follow-up in the HUNT Study.","Numerous studies have examined associations between overweight and obesity and risk of low back pain (LBP), but the exact magnitude of these associations is not yet clear. The purpose of this work was to assess such sex-specific associations in a community-based setting in Norway, taking into account potential relationships with other risk factors. A cohort study was conducted combining data from two waves of the Trøndelag Health Study, HUNT3 (2006-2008) and HUNT4 (2017-2019). Separate analyses were performed of risk of chronic LBP in HUNT4 among 14,775 individuals without chronic LBP in HUNT3, and of recurrence or persistence in HUNT4 among 5034 individuals with chronic LBP in HUNT3. Relative risks were estimated in generalised linear models for overweight and obesity compared to normal weight. Body size classification was based on values of BMI computed from measurements of height and weight. Chronic LBP was defined as LBP persisting at least 3 months during last year. After adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity in leisure time and work activity, analysis of risk among women produced relative risks 1.11 (95% CI 1.00-1.23) for overweight, 1.36 (95% CI 1.20-1.54) for obesity class I and 1.68 (95% CI 1.42-2.00) for obesity classes II-III. Relative risks among men were 1.10 (95% CI 0.94-1.28) for overweight, 1.36 (95% CI 1.13-1.63) for obesity class I and 1.02 (95% CI 0.70-1.50) for obesity classes II-III, the last estimate being based on relatively few individuals. Analyses of recurrence or persistence indicated similar relationships but with smaller magnitude of relative risks and no drop in risk among obesity classes II-III in men. The change in BMI from HUNT3 to HUNT4 hardly differed between individuals with and without chronic LBP in HUNT3. Risk of chronic LBP increases with higher values of BMI in both sexes, although it is uncertain whether this applies to very obese men. Very obese women carry a particularly large risk. Probabilities of recurrence or persistence of chronic LBP among those already afflicted also increase with higher values of BMI. Adjustment for other factors does not influence relationships with overweight and obesity to any major extent.","Ingrid Heuch, Ivar Heuch, Knut Hagen, John-Anker Zwart","BMC public health","2024Sep27","Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Middle Aged; Obesity; Norway; Overweight; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Chronic Pain; Aged; Cohort Studies; Sex Factors; Body Mass Index"

In Ethiopia, children living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy due to comorbidities such as anemia, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and poor socio-economic status. Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy among children living with HIV in Ethiopia using a simple clinical screening tool. A health institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 148 children aged 5 to 18 years living with HIV who are receiving treatment at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic of the randomly selected public health institutions in the Gamo zone. An interview and neurologic examination were conducted. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome variable. Variables with p-value < 0.25 in the bi-variable logistic regression analysis were entered and checked for association in a multivariable logistic regression model. The level of statistical significance was declared at the p-value < 0.05. In this study, 148 children participated, making a response rate of 97.5%. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the respondents was 15.03 ± 2.99 years, and 81(54.7%) were male. The magnitude of PN was 20.9% (31/148).

"39333998","Hyperandrogenism and anthropometric parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","One of the main features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is increased adipose tissue, which can result in hormonal disturbances. In the present study, we aimed to investigate which indicator of obesity could better associate with hormonal disturbances in PCOS women. In this cross-sectional analysis, women with PCOS were included according to the Rotterdam criteria. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for biochemical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Anthropometric measures comprised body composition indices (assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis [BIA]), waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Linear regression modeling was used to assess the association between anthropometric indices and hormonal imbalance, adjusted for age, mensuration status, and the homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were utilized to ascertain the sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cut-off points of various anthropometric indices in identifying hyperandrogenism. A total of 129 PCOS women with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 32.0 (23.0-32.0) years and a median BMI of 26.3 (23.00-29.70) kg/m2 were enrolled. In the adjusted linear regression model, BMI (β = 0.053, P < 0.001), waist circumference (β = 0.021, P = 0.001), WHtR (β = 3.325, P = 0.002), total fat mass (β = 0.021, P = 0.002), trunk fat mass (β = 0.038, P = 0.006), and leg fat mass (β = 0.045, P = 0.004) were positively associated with free androgen index (FAI). In addition, BMI (β=-0.017, P = 0.003), waist circumference (β=-0.008, P = 0.002), WHtR (β=-1.167, P = 0.004), total fat mass (β=-0.008, P=0.003), trunk fat mass (β=-0.017, P=0.001), and leg fat mass (β=-0.018, P=0.004) were negatively associated with the serum level of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).

All participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, including intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Anterior segment parameters, such as central corneal thickness (CCT), axial length (AL), aqueous depth (AD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and lens thickness (LT) were measured using optic biometry. Endothelial cell density (ECD) was assessed using non-contact specular microscopy. The BMI was calculated, and serum levels of estradiol and testosterone were noted. IOP was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.003) and CCT was significantly thicker (p = 0.004) in all phenotypes of PCOS compared to the control group. BMI, serum estradiol and free testosterone were found to correlate with both IOP and CCT. AL, AD, ACD and LT values showed no significant differences compared to the control group. Although ECD tend to be higher in the PCOS phenotypes, this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Given our findings that CCT and IOP are significantly elevated in PCOS phenotypes.

Cumulative Excess Weight (CEW) and Cumulative Excess Waist Circumference (CEWC) scores were calculated, which represent the accumulation of deviations from expected body mass index and waist circumference values over time until the development of CKD or the end of the follow-up period. Time-dependent Cox models were used to investigate the sex-stratified association of CEW and CEWC with CKD incidence while controlling for confounding variables. Out of the 8697 participants who were evaluated in this study, 56% (4865) were women and the mean age was 40 ± 14. During the 15-year follow-up period, 41.7% (3629) of the participants developed CKD. Among the CKD patients, 65.4% (829) of men and 77.9% (1839) of women had a BMI higher than 25, and high WC was found to be 73.7% (934) and 55.3% (1306) for men and women, respectively. We found a significant association between one standard deviation change of CEW and the development of CKD in both sexes (fully adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CI of CEW in men and women were 1.155 [1.081-1.232) and 1.105 (1.047-1.167)]. However, the association between CEWC and CKD development was only significant among men participants [HR = 1.074 (1.006-1.147)].

This study aimed to analyze risk factors for developing PONB after rectal cancer surgery, particularly the association between pelvic anatomy and visceral fat mass. We included 138 patients who underwent rectal resection for lower rectal cancer in our department between 2017 and 2021. PONB was defined as the need for urethral catheter reinsertion or oral medication administration for urinary retention after catheter removal with severe NB that required treatment for ≥ 60 days. We obtained visceral fat area (VFA) at the umbilical level based on a CT scan and measured five pelvic dimensions. Of the 138 patients, 19 developed PONB, with 16 being severe cases. PONB more frequently occurs in patients with a height of < 158 cm, age ≥ 70 years, surgery lasting ≥ 8 h, intraoperative bleeding volume ≥ 150 mL, lateral lymph node dissection, and narrower pelvis. It was more prevalent in cases with low VFA. Conversely, gender, body mass index (BMI), and medical history showed no significant correlations. Multivariate analysis revealed older age, prolonged surgery, and low VFA as independent risk factors for PONB. Independent risk factors for severe PONB included low VFA, older age, prolonged surgery, and deep pelvis. Lower VFA, older age, and prolonged surgery are independent risk factors for developing PONB. Additionally, a deep pelvis is an independent risk factor for severe PONB. Delicate surgical techniques should consider the risk of nerve injury in cases with low VFA and deep pelvis.","Tomohiro Matsui, Jun Kiuchi, Yoshiaki Kuriu, Tomohiro Arita, Hiroki Shimizu, Kenji Nanishi, Ryo Morimura, Atsushi Shiozaki, Hisashi Ikoma, Takeshi Kubota, Hitoshi Fujiwara, Eigo Otsuji","BMC gastroenterology","2024Sep27","Humans; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Aged; Rectal Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Pelvis; Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic; Retrospective Studies; Aged, 80 and over; Operative Time; Age Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Adult"

ANRS0001SCOV-POPART is a French nationwide multicenter prospective observational cohort study assessing the immune response to Covid-19 vaccines routinely administered to 11 subgroups of patients with chronic disease and a control group. Participants from the ANRS0001S COV-POPART were included if they received at least two doses of Covid-19 vaccine for the primary vaccine course, had measurements of anti-Spike, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG-specific or neutralizing antibodies one month after the end of the primary vaccine course, without being infected by SARS-CoV-2 before the measurement. SARS-CoV-2 infections defined by a positive PCR/antigenic test or seroconversion to detectable anti nucleocapsid antibodies were evaluated until the first COVID-19 booster injection. Cox proportional hazards models taking into account interval-censored data were implemented to estimate the association between each antibody level and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Predictive performances were evaluated by the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Two thousand five hundred seventy adults from a specific population and 1,123 from the control group were included. The cumulative probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infections at five months after serological measurement were 6.0% 95% confidence interval: [5.0; 7.9] and 10.1% 95% confidence interval: [8.3; 11.9], respectively. Higher levels of anti-Spike IgG antibody were associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the control group, but not in the specific populations. Among the specific populations, AUROC were 74.5%, 74.9%, and 72.4% for anti-Spike IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. AUROC were superior in the specific populations, 82.0%, 81.2%, and 81.4% for anti-Spike IgG, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Vaccine-induced antibody response after the primary course of Covid-19 infection only moderately discriminated between participants developing a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron wave.

"39333899","Predicting diabetes in adults: identifying important features in unbalanced data over a 5-year cohort study using machine learning algorithm.","Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in predictive modeling, leading to biased outcomes and reduced model reliability. This study addresses data imbalance in diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques. Utilizing data from the Fasa Adult Cohort Study (FACS) with a 5-year follow-up of 10,000 participants, we developed predictive models for Type 2 diabetes. We employed various data-level and algorithm-level interventions, including SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTEENN, Random Over Sampling and KMeansSMOTE, paired with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. We evaluated model performance using F1 score, AUC, and G-means-metrics chosen to provide a comprehensive assessment of model accuracy, discrimination ability, and overall balance in performance, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets. our study uncovered key factors influencing diabetes risk and evaluated the performance of various machine learning models. Feature importance analysis revealed that the most influential predictors of diabetes differ between males and females. For females, the most important factors are triglyceride (TG), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and total cholesterol (CHOL), whereas for males, the key predictors are body Mass Index (BMI), serum glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (SGOT), and Gamma-Glutamyl (GGT). Across the entire dataset, BMI remains the most important variable, followed by SGOT, BMR, and energy intake. These insights suggest that gender-specific risk profiles should be considered in diabetes prevention and management strategies. In terms of model performance, our results show that ADASYN with MLP classifier achieved an F1 score of 82.17 ± 3.38, AUC of 89.61 ± 2.09, and G-means of 89.15 ± 2.31. SMOTE with MLP followed closely with an F1 score of 79.85 ± 3.91, AUC of 89.7 ± 2.54, and G-means of 89.31 ± 2.78. The SMOTEENN with Random Forest combination achieved an F1 score of 78.27 ± 1.54, AUC of 87.18 ± 1.12, and G-means of 86.47 ± 1.28. These combinations effectively address class imbalance, improving the accuracy and reliability of diabetes predictions. The findings highlight the importance of using appropriate data-balancing techniques in medical data analysis.","Maryam Talebi Moghaddam, Yones Jahani, Zahra Arefzadeh, Azizallah Dehghan, Mohsen Khaleghi, Mehdi Sharafi, Ghasem Nikfar","BMC medical research methodology","2024Sep27","Humans; Machine Learning; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Male; Algorithms; Adult; Cohort Studies; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Reproducibility of Results"
"39333898","A comparison of principal component analysis, reduced-rank regression, and partial least-squares in the identification of dietary patterns associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in Iranian overweight and obese women.","According to epidemiological studies, unhealthy dietary patterns and lifestyle lead to rising obesity and cardiometabolic diseases in Iran. Hybrid techniques were used to identify a dietary pattern characterized by fiber, folic acid, and carotenoid intake due to their association with cardiometabolic risk factors such as anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, lipid profile, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI), Homeostatic Model Assessment Index (HOMA Index), cardiometabolic index (CMI), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1). So, the objective of the recent study is to compare the reduced-rank regression (RRR) and partial least-squares (PLS) approaches to principal component analysis (PCA) for estimating diet-cardiometabolic risk factor correlations in Iranian obese women. Data on dietary intake was gathered from 376 healthy overweight and obese females aged 18 to 65 years using a 147-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In this cross-sectional study, participants were referred to health centers of Tehran. Dietary patterns were developed using PCA, PLS, and RRR, and their outputs were assessed to identify reasonable patterns connected to cardiometabolic risk factors. The response variables for PLS and RRR were fiber, folic acid, and carotenoid intake. In this study, 3 dietary patterns were identified by the PCA method, 2 dietary patterns by the PLS method, and one dietary pattern by the RRR method. High adherence to the plant-based dietary pattern identified by all methods were associated with higher fat free mass index (FFMI) (P < 0.05). Women in the highest tertile of the plant-based dietary pattern identified by PLS had 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.007,0.66, P = 0.02), 0.36 mmHg (95% CI: 0.14,0.88, P = 0.02), and 0.46 mg/l (95% CI: 0.25,0.82, P < 0.001), lower FBS, DBP, and CRP respectively than women in the first tertile. Also, PLS and RRR-derived patterns explained greater variance in the outcome (PCA: 1.05%; PLS: 11.62%; RRR: 25.28%), while the PCA dietary patterns explained greater variance in the food groups (PCA: 22.81%; PLS: 14.54%; RRR: 1.59%). PLS was found to be more appropriate in determining dietary patterns associated with cardiometabolic-related risk factors. Nevertheless, the advantage of PLS over PCA and RRR must be confirmed in future longitudinal studies with extended follow-up in different settings, population groups, and response variables.","Fatemeh Gholami, Ahmadreza Hajiheidari, Bahareh Barkhidarian, Neda Soveid, Mir Saeid Yekaninejad, Zahra Karimi, Niki Bahrampour, Seyed Ali Keshavarz, Gholamali Javdan, Khadijeh Mirzaei","BMC medical research methodology","2024Sep27","Humans; Female; Iran; Adult; Middle Aged; Principal Component Analysis; Obesity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Overweight; Least-Squares Analysis; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Diet; Young Adult; Aged; Risk Factors; Folic Acid; Cardiovascular Diseases; Adolescent; Feeding Behavior; Dietary Patterns"
"39333881","Triglyceride-glucose index as a predictor of cardiac adverse events in acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: role of diabetes.","Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), a surrogate marker of insulin resistance (IR), could be a potential prognostic marker in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We evaluated the effect of the TyG index on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This registry-based cohort study was conducted at Tehran Heart Center from 2015 to 2021 and the median follow-up duration was 378 days. The primary outcome was MACCE and the secondary outcomes were MACCE components: all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization, and coronary artery bypass grafting. For comparison among TyG quartiles (Q), the log-rank test was used. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe the association between TyG quartiles and MACCE. A subgroup of euglycemic patients was also evaluated. A total of 13,542 patients were included. Patients in the fourth TyG quartile (Q4) were younger, had higher mean BMI, and higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The adjusted Cox model showed that a 1-unit increment of the TyG index was associated with a significantly higher risk of MACCE (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30, p < 0.001). Among TyG quartiles, there was a higher MACCE incidence in Q4 compared to Q1 (aHR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.53, p = 0.005). In the euglycemic subgroup of the population, there was no significant association between MACCE incidence and a 1-unit increase in TyG or among TyG quartiles. Based on our findings, while higher TyG levels and quartiles were associated with higher rates of MACCE in ACS, there was no such effect in the euglycemic population. If confirmed in future studies, these results can be beneficial for clinicians to risk stratify these patients with an easy-to-use index and determine clinical plans based on their risk.","Amirmohammad Khalaji, Amir Hossein Behnoush, Yeganeh Pasebani, Ali Rafati, Tara Mahmoodi, Alireza Arzhangzadeh, Sima Shamshiri Khamene, Izat MohammadKhawajah, Mehdi Mehrani, Ali Vasheghani-Farahani, Farzad Masoudkabir, Kimia Najafi, Mani K Askari, Anil Harrison, John R Nelson, Kaveh Hosseini, Adrian V Hernandez","BMC cardiovascular disorders","2024Sep27","Humans; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Blood Glucose; Aged; Risk Assessment; Biomarkers; Triglycerides; Registries; Risk Factors; Iran; Time Factors; Diabetes Mellitus; Treatment Outcome; Predictive Value of Tests; Insulin Resistance"
"39333842","Predictors and clinical outcomes of slow flow phenomenon in diabetic patients with chronic coronary syndrome.","Coronary slow flow (CSF) is characterized by late distal coronary perfusion of coronary arteries at the time of angiography despite the vessels appearing normal. The importance of CSF is still debatable. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate CSF's predictors and clinical outcomes in diabetic patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). This retrospective study included 250 diabetic patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina and referred for coronary angiography (CAG), showing normal coronaries with CSF (Group I) and 240 diabetic patients with normal coronaries and normal flow (Group II). The patients in both groups were followed up for one year to evaluate clinical outcomes. The incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was higher in Group I than in Group II, but the difference was not statistically significant except when the composite endpoints of STEMI, NSTEMI, and unstable angina were combined under the term ACS. The independent predictors of CSF, as detected by multivariate regression analysis, were body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.694, 95% CI = 0.295-0.842, P = 0.010), blood glucose during catheterization (OR = 0.647, 95% CI = 0.298-0.874, P = 0.008), serum triglycerides (OR = 0.574, 95% CI = 0.289-0.746, P = 0.010), and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 0.618, 95% CI = 0.479-0.892, P = 0.001).

This study aims to investigate and compare the prognostic value and clinical utility of pre-treatment nutritional indicators in elderly rectal cancer (RC) patients. We retrospectively collected data from 361 elderly rectal cancer patients. The optimal cut-off values for pre-treatment nutritional indicators were calculated using ROC curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were conducted to identify independent prognostic nutritional indicators. The predictive performance and clinical utility of these independent nutritional indicators was evaluated using time-dependent ROC. Multivariate analyses showed that body mass index (BMI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI), and platelet-albumin ratio (PAR) independently predicted overall survival and progression-free survival in elderly RC patients (all p < 0.05), except for advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI). According to the nomogram model, the pre-treatment nutritional prognosis score was calculated and the patients were risk stratified. The KM curve showed that the survival of the high-risk group was significantly worse than that of the low-moderate risk group. Time-dependent ROC indicated that novel nutritional prognostic indicator (NNPI) had the best predictive ability compared with the independent prognostic nutritional indicator. Subgroup analysis also showed that NNPI had prognostic value across different clinical factors and had significant clinical utility. In elderly RC patients, BMI, PNI, GNRI, PAR, and NNPI serve as objective assessment tools for nutrition-related mortality risk. Identifying elderly patients at higher nutritional risk can guide early clinical nutritional interventions and improve patient outcomes.","Jianjian Qiu, Yilin Yu, Zhiping Wang, Liang Hong, Lingdong Shao, Junxin Wu","Scientific reports","2024Sep27","Humans; Aged; Male; Female; Rectal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Nutrition Assessment; Nutritional Status; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Geriatric Assessment; ROC Curve"

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 7,645 individuals aged 20 and above from the NHANES 2017-2020. Multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of the logarithmically transformed SII (lgSII) with BMI and waist circumference. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression was utilized to explore the relationship between lgSII and the prevalence of obesity. Fitted smoothing curves and threshold-effect analysis were applied to elucidate nonlinear relationships. In the fully adjusted model, a positive relationship was observed between lgSII and BMI, waist circumference, and obesity prevalence (β = 3.13, 95% CI 2.10-4.16; β = 7.81, 95% CI 5.50-10.13; OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.12-1.86). The variables of gender, age, race, education, marital status, poverty income ratio (PIR), energy intake, sleep disorder, smoking status, and alcohol use did not significantly modify the positive association between lgSII and obesity. However, physical activity appeared to influence the positive correlation between lgSII and obesity. Using a two-segment linear regression model, an inverted U-shaped relationship was observed between lgSII and both BMI and waist circumference. Furthermore, lgSII demonstrated a linear positive correlation with obesity prevalence. When stratified by physical activity, lgSII showed a non-significant negative correlation with obesity in the physically active group. Our findings underscore a robust association between the logarithmically transformed SII and BMI, waist circumference, and the prevalence of obesity.","Shuo Yang, Shan Zhang, Jinrong Deng, Jingjing Xie, Jianyong Zhang, Ertao Jia","Scientific reports","2024Sep27","Humans; Obesity; Waist Circumference; Body Mass Index; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Prevalence; United States; Cross-Sectional Studies; Inflammation; Nutrition Surveys; Aged; Young Adult; Risk Factors"

"39333477","Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition-defined malnutrition coexisting with visceral adiposity predicted worse long-term all-cause mortality among inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis.","Malnutrition coexisting with abdominal adipose tissue accumulation bring a double burden on prognosis. More recently, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) has reached a novel consensus concerning the diagnostic criteria, that is, a two-step modality combining nutritional risk screening and subsequent phenotypic/etiologic parameters for comprehensive evaluation in hopes of harmonizing the malnutrition diagnosis. We aimed to elucidate their synergistic impact among inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis concerning long-term mortality. Malnutrition, visceral obesity, and visceral adiposity were defined by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), visceral fat area (VFA), and visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) on computed tomography, respectively. Accordingly, the patients were categorized into different groups given their nutritional status and visceral obesity/adiposity. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify independent risk factors associated with 1-year all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were compared among distinct groups. Totally, 295 patients were recruited. GLIM, VFA, and VSR identified 131 (44.4%), 158 (53.6%), and 59 (20%) patients with malnutrition, visceral obesity and visceral adiposity, respectively. Malnutrition coexisted with visceral obesity in 55 (MO group) relative to visceral adiposity in 40 patients (MA group). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that MA (hazard ratio: 2.48; 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 5.79; P = 0.036) was independently associated with dire outcome rather than MO. Moreover, patients with cirrhosis in the MA group had the worst survival status when compared with other groups (log-rank test: P < 0.001). The current study indicated that coexisting GLIM-defined malnutrition and VSR-defined visceral adiposity were in relation to worse long-term mortality among inpatients. It is imperative to delicately manage nutritional status and provide personalized treatment in this vulnerable subgroup for achieving better prognosis.","Han Wang, Tianming Zhao, Gaoyue Guo, Wanting Yang, Xuqian Zhang, Fang Yang, Jie Yang, Yangyang Hui, Xiaoyu Wang, Binxin Cui, Xiaofei Fan, Huanli Jiao, Chao Sun","Nutrition & diabetes","2024Sep27","Humans; Male; Malnutrition; Female; Middle Aged; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Liver Cirrhosis; Obesity, Abdominal; Aged; Risk Factors; Nutritional Status; Prognosis; Inpatients; Adiposity; Proportional Hazards Models"

A cross-sectional study with 90 women assessed from 2020 to 2022. Isthmocele was a composite variable diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or diagnostic hysteroscopy (DxHys) and were asked about clinical symptoms, sociodemographic and obstetrical history and quality of life by the WHO-QOL questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) plus 95% confidence intervals-CI) were performed to seek factors associated with the presence of isthmocele (5% significance level).The prevalence of isthmocele after combining MRI, TVUS and DxHys was 63.3% (n = 57). Women with isthmocele presented a higher body mass index (BMI) measured during delivery (32.70 ± 6.07 vs. 28.28 ± 9.86 kg/m2;p < 0.05) than women without isthmocele. Other sociodemographic variables, obstetrical history and WHO-QOL subdomains did not differ between groups. Within women with isthmocele, the residual myometrial mantle had an average of 4.97 ± 1.57 cm. Uterine volume was higher in the isthmocele group (103.95 vs. 81.34 cm3; p = 0.08), but with no statistical difference. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) has reported that the factors associated with isthmocele were: higher BMI during delivery (aOR = 1.26[1.07-1.49];p < 0.05); longer interpartum interval (aOR = 1.22[1.03-1.46];p = 0.02) and presence of more than two cesarean sections (aOR = 2.16[1.16-4.01];p = 0.02).

"39333407","Prevalence of vertebral fractures and associated factors in thai diabetic postmenopausal women.","T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) patients with vertebral fractures have a higher mortality rate than non-DM (nondiabetic patients). However, the prevalence of vertebral fractures in the Asian diabetic population is not well established. Moreover, despite an apparent increase in fracture risk in patients with diabetes, Asian countries have provided contradictory data demonstrating that bone mineral density (BMD) varies significantly in T2DM patients. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the prevalence of vertebral fractures and osteoporosis, as well as BMD and the FRAX score, between individuals with and without T2DM and assess the association of these factors with vertebral fractures. Postmenopausal Thai women attending diabetic and health check-up clinics were recruited. BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck was measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A morphometric vertebral fracture (VF) was defined by a lateral thoracolumbar (T-L) X-ray radiograph. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) was used to calculate the 10-year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), which were calculated on the basis of the Thai FRAX model. A total of 435 participants were recruited, including 145 postmenopausal women with T2DM and 290 non-DM individuals. T2DM patients had a significantly greater BMI (p = 0.006) and BMD at the femoral neck (p = 0.024) and total hip (p = 0.017), but there was no significant difference in the FRAX score, including the 10-year probability of hip fracture or MOF, either with or without BMD, between individuals with and without T2DM. The prevalence of osteoporosis in non-DM women was significantly higher at the femoral neck (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.93, p = 0.029) but comparable at the lumbar spine. Individuals with T2DM had a significantly higher rate of vertebral fractures, particularly those involving two or more levels, than those without T2DM. Diabetes was significantly associated with [Formula: see text]2 VF (OR = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.77 to 8.28, p = 0.001), and the association remained unchanged after controlling for other clinical factors (adjusted OR = 3.72, 95% CI 1.70-8.15; p = 0.001).

"39333229","Expression of Intelectin-1, also known as Omentin-1, is related to clinical phenotypes such as overweight, obesity, insulin resistance, and changes after bariatric surgery.","Intelectin-1 (ITLN1; also Omentin-1, OMNT1) is secreted by adipose tissue (AT) and plays an important role in glucose metabolism regulation, with links to obesity-associated diseases. ITLN1 activity so far has rarely been investigated using RNA-sequencing and in larger cohorts. We evaluated ITLN1 expression among three clinical cohorts of the Leipzig Obesity BioBank-a cross-sectional cohort comprising of 1480 people, a cohort of people with metabolically healthy or unhealthy obesity (31 insulin-sensitive, 42 insulin-resistant individuals with obesity), and a longitudinal two-step bariatric surgery cohort (n = 65). We hypothesized that AT ITLN1 expression is associated with serum omentin-1, clinical parameters associated with obesity, and with weight loss after bariatric surgery. We also investigated the correlation of AT ITLN1 expression with genes related to inflammatory response, lipid metabolism, obesity, and regulation of energy balance. Likewise, we inspected gene group expression and metabolic pathways associated with ITLN1 expression using gene set enrichment and gene correlation analysis. We show that ITLN1 expression differs in VAT and SAT, and should therefore be analyzed separately. Furthermore, ITLN1 expression increases with VAT tissue mass, but is negatively affected by AT tissue dysfunction among individuals with unhealthy obesity, corroborated by interplay with genes related to tissue inflammation. Gene set enrichment and gene correlation analysis of ITLN1 expression suggest that AT ITLN1 expression is related to local inflammatory processes in AT, but also in processes such as regulation of appetite, energy balance, and maintenance of body weight.","Paul Czechowski, Tobias Hagemann, Adhideb Ghosh, Wenfei Sun, Hua Dong, Falko Noé, Corinna Niersmann, Isabel Reinisch, Christian Wolfrum, Christian Herder, Arne Dietrich, Matthias Blüher, Anne Hoffmann","Scientific reports","2024Sep27","Humans; GPI-Linked Proteins; Insulin Resistance; Bariatric Surgery; Lectins; Obesity; Cytokines; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Phenotype; Overweight; Weight Loss; Adipose Tissue; Cohort Studies"
"39333152","A comparative study of hormonal contraceptive use and vitamin D levels at Gondar Town 2023.","Vitamin D deficiency is an emerging public health problem globally, with devastating health consequences. Some studies suggest that exogenous sex hormones, found in hormonal contraceptives, may enhance vitamin D levels. However, the reasons for this association are not fully understood, as women using hormonal contraception may have different lifestyle habits affecting their vitamin D status. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and vitamin D levels. A Facility based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in Gondar town from February to April 2023, involving a total of 162 women using three types of hormonal contraceptives (Norplant, DMPA, and COC) and 162 age and BMI-matched non-users as controls in a 1:1 ratio. Participants were selected using systematic random sampling. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collected data regarding the socio-demographic, economic, obstetric, lifestyle, and clinical information. 5 milliliters of blood samples were collected from each participant for Laboratory analysis of serum vitamin D, calcium, and alkaline phosphates using a Beckman Coulter chemistry analyzer. Independent t-tests, ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare statistics between the two groups, and logistic regression models to identify factors associated with Vitamin D deficiency. The mean serum Vitamin D levels of Norplant, DMPA, and COC users were 24.08 (± 5.17), 24.83 (± 5.52), and 31.90 (± 6.94) respectively; whereas control group has mean Vitamin D level of 22.00 (± 7.97). On the current study the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) among hormonal contraceptive users was found to be 21.6% (35/162), whereas 48.14% (78/162) of non-user controls had vitamin D deficiency. The odds of having Vitamin D deficiency was higher among participants who attained higher education, who never eat fish and have never been used vitamin D Supplements. However, the use of combined oral contraceptives (COC) shown to reduce the odd of having vitamin D deficiency by 90%. Similarly, individuals with normal and hypercalcemia state shown to have lower odd of having Vitamin D deficiency. Users of combined oral contraceptives (COC) had significantly higher mean serum Vitamin D levels compared to users of Norplant and DMPA, as well as non-users.

Exclusion criteria comprised the absence of the second molar, the presence of systemic diseases, a history of radiation therapy, and pregnancy or lactation. Participants completed a questionnaire covering demographic data, physical metrics, and information on systemic conditions and disorders. Preoperative assessments included vital sign measurements. Panoramic imaging was employed to evaluate the third molar distance to the occlusal plane, degrees of angulation, eruption space, and distance to the alveolar inferior canal. Surgical difficulty in this study was measured by two outcomes: surgical time and technique.  To assess differences in impacted third molar positions among groups, Independent samples t-test and One-way analysis of variance were used for normally distributed data without outliers; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were utilized. The Spearman's rank correlation was utilized to explore relationships between vital signs, impacted third molar positions, surgical time, and surgical technique.  There were no significant differences in third molar positions between age and body mass index groups. Significant differences in distance to the occlusal plane were observed between third molars in quadrants 2 and 3 (p = 0.002) and quadrants 2 and 4 (p = 0.005). A significant difference in eruption space was found between sexes (p = 0.016). A significant negative correlation was discovered between surgical time and respiration rate per minute (p = 0.028).  This study found that males have greater third molar eruption space than females, and maxillary third molars have a greater distance to the occlusal plane compared with mandibular third molars. The importance of vital signs as contributing factors to surgical difficulty is highlighted, emphasizing their relevance in clinical practice.","Endang Sjamsudin, Anggun Rafisa, Nuroh Najmi","European journal of dentistry","2024Sep27",NA
"39332893","Ankle sprains in male Israeli infantry soldiers during training: prevalence and risk factors.","Given the high incidence and heavy burden of ankle sprains in recruits, large-scale, multifactorial investigations into potential risk factors are warranted. This study aimed to identify the incidence of ankle sprains and associated risk factors among new military recruits during their infantry training. The study included 365 infantry recruits (aged 18-21 years), who were inducted into service in March 2022. These recruits were monitored for ankle sprains throughout their basicy and advanced infantry training by a physiotherapist. Preinduction smoking habits, physical fitness preparation and recurrent ankle sprains were recorded. Anthropometric measures, lower-extremity functional movement, Achilles tendon structure, perceived ankle instability, and mechanical ankle instability were assessed at the onset of both training periods. Ankle sprains were diagnosed in 109 trainees (29.9%) during both the basic and the advanced training periods. Preinduction recurrent ankle sprains were reported by 28.2% of the participants. The relative risk of a recruit with preinduction ankle sprains suffering a subsequent sprain during training was 1.66 (p=0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that reduced proprioception ability (OR=0.002), higher body mass index (OR=1.08), preinduction recurrent sprains (OR=1.95) and lack of physical fitness preparation (OR=3.12) were related to ankle sprains throughout the complete basic-and-advanced training period. Preinduction recurrent ankle sprains (OR=3.37) and reduced Achilles tendon quality (OR=1.30) were associated with ankle sprains during the advanced training period. Lower-extremity functional movement, body mass index, preinduction recurrent sprains, physical preparation and reduced Achilles tendon quality were associated with the risk of ankle sprains during training. These findings could contribute to developing prevention and intervention programmes for reducing ankle sprains in military trainees.","Nili Steinberg, Michal Shenhar, Gali Dar, Gordon Waddington, Jeremy Witchalls, Omer Paulman, Chuck Milgrom, Aharon Finestone","Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention","2024Sep27",NA
"39332852","Deep learning assessment of senescence-associated nuclear morphologies in mammary tissue from healthy female donors to predict future risk of breast cancer: a retrospective cohort study.","Cellular senescence has been associated with cancer as either a barrier mechanism restricting autonomous cell proliferation or a tumour-promoting microenvironmental mechanism that secretes proinflammatory paracrine factors. With most work done in non-human models and the heterogeneous nature of senescence, the precise role of senescent cells in the development of cancer in humans is not well understood. Furthermore, more than 1 million non-malignant breast biopsies are taken every year that could be a major resource for risk stratification. We aimed to explore the clinical relevance for breast cancer development of markers of senescence in mammary tissue from healthy female donors. In this retrospective cohort study, we applied single-cell deep learning senescence predictors, based on nuclear morphology, to histological images of haematoxylin and eosin-stained breast biopsy samples from healthy female donors at the Komen Tissue Bank (KTB) at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (Indianapolis, IN, USA). All KTB participants (aged ≥18 years) who underwent core biopsies for research purposes between 2009 and 2019 were eligible for the study. Senescence was predicted in the epithelial (terminal duct lobular units [TDLUs] and non-TDLU epithelium), stromal, and adipose tissue compartments using validated models, previously trained on cells induced to senescence by ionising radiation (IR), replicative exhaustion (or replicative senescence; RS), or antimycin A, atazanavir-ritonavir, and doxorubicin (AAD) exposures. To benchmark our senescence-based cancer prediction results, we generated 5-year Gail scores-the current clinical gold standard for breast cancer risk prediction-for participants aged 35 years and older on the basis of characteristics at the time of tissue donation. The primary outcome was estimated odds of breast cancer via logistic modelling for each tissue compartment based on predicted senescence scores in cases (participants who had been diagnosed with breast cancer as of data cutoff, July 31, 2022) and controls (those who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer). 4382 female donors (median age at donation 45 years [IQR 34-57]) were eligible for the study. As of data cutoff (median follow-up of 10 years [7-11]), 86 (2·0%) had developed breast cancer a mean of 4·8 years (SD 2·84) after date of donation and 4296 (98·0%) had not received a breast cancer diagnosis. Among the 86 cases, we found significant differences in adipose-specific IR and AAD senescence prediction scores compared with controls. Risk analysis showed that individuals in the upper half (above the median) of scores for the adipose tissue IR model had higher odds of developing breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1·71 [95% CI 1·10-2·68]; p=0·019), whereas the adipose AAD model revealed a reduced odds of developing breast cancer (OR 0·57 [0·36-0·88]; p=0·013). For the other tissue compartments and the RS model, no significant associations were found (except for stromal tissue via the IR model, had higher odds of developing breast cancer [OR 1·59, 1·03-2·49]). Individuals with both of the adipose risk factors had an OR of 3·32 (1·68-7·03; p=0·0009). Participants with 5-year Gail scores above the median had an OR for development of cancer of 2·33 (1·46-3·82; p=0·0012) compared with those with scores below the median. When combining Gail scores with our adipose AAD risk model, we found that individuals with both of these predictors had an OR of 4·70 (2·29-10·90; p<0·0001). When combining the Gail score with our adipose IR model, we found that individuals with both predictors had an OR of 3·45 (1·77-7·24; p=0·0002). Assessment of senescence-associated nuclear morphologies with deep learning allows prediction of future cancer risk from normal breast biopsy samples. The combination of multiple models improved prediction of future breast cancer compared with the current clinical benchmark, the Gail model. Our results suggest an important role for microscope image-based deep learning models in predicting future cancer development. Such models could be incorporated into current breast cancer risk assessment and screening protocols.

The total number of infections between birth and ~14 years of age with subgroup analysis by infection type and age. A total of 9037 mothers and 9540 children were included in the main analysis. 45% of women were of Pakistani ethnicity and 6417 women (56%) were overweight or obese. There was an overall trend for an increasing infection rate with increasing maternal BMI. In adjusted models, only those with obesity grade 2-3 had offspring with significantly higher rates of infection during the first year of life (RR 1.12 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.20)) compared with women of healthy weight. However, by age 5 to <15 years, children born to overweight women (RR 1.09 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.16)), obese grade 1 women (RR 1.18 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.28)) or obese grade 2 women (RR 1.31 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.48)) all had significantly higher rates of infection compared with those born to healthy weight mothers. Respiratory tract and skin/soft tissue infections made up the majority of excess infections. Maternal BMI was positively associated with rates of offspring infection in this study cohort, and suggests that we should be supporting women to achieve a healthy weight for pregnancy. Future research should investigate whether this is replicated in other populations, whether there is a causal association and the potential mechanisms and areas for intervention.","Victoria Coathup, Helen Frances Ashdown, Claire Carson, Gillian Santorelli, Maria A Quigley","Archives of disease in childhood","2024Sep27",NA
"39332772","A Systematic Review on the Impact of Plant-Based Milk Consumption on Growth and Nutrition in Children and Adolescents.","Children are increasingly consuming plant-based milks, yet the impact on their growth and nutrition is unclear. This systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the impact of plant-based milk consumption on growth and nutrition in children and adolescents. MEDLINE, Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, and Scopus were comprehensively searched from 2000 to 2024 to identify studies evaluating the growth and nutritional effects of plant-based milk consumption in children aged 1-18 y. Two reviewers independently screened full-text articles, assessed their quality, and extracted data. A total of 6 studies were identified: 3 cross-sectional studies, 1 prospective cohort study, and 2 clinical trials (total n = 15,815). Observational studies found that consumption of plant-based milk was associated with lower childhood body mass index, height, and lower serum vitamin D concentrations compared with cow milk. No association was found between soy milk consumption and BMI in adolescent girls. Low-quality clinical trials showed minimal effects on growth, and 1 study found that adolescent girls with low calcium intake who consumed fortified soy milk had higher bone density compared with those who did not consume soy milk. Available evidence suggests that children who consume plant-based milk may have lower body mass index, height, and micronutrient intake compared with those who consume cow milk, whereas fortified soy milk may support bone health in adolescents who do not drink cow milk. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether these associations persist over time, differ between children and adolescents or for those who consume soy milk, and to understand the potential underlying mechanisms.

"39332769","Identification and replication of urine metabolites associated with short-term and habitual intake of sweet and fatty snacks in European children and adolescents.","Intake of sweet and fatty snacks may partly contribute to the occurrence of obesity and other health conditions in childhood. Traditional dietary assessment methods may be limited in accurately assessing the intake of sweet and fatty snacks in children. Metabolite biomarkers may aid the objective assessment of children's food intake and support establishing diet-disease relationships. The present study aimed to identify biomarkers of sweet and fatty snack intake in two independent cohorts of European children. We used data from the IDEFICS/I.Family cohort from baseline (2007/2008) and two follow-up examination waves (2009/2010 and 2013/2014). In total, n=1788 urine samples from 599 children were analysed for untargeted metabolomics using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Short-term dietary intake was assessed by 24-hour dietary recalls, and habitual dietary intake was calculated with the National Cancer Institute method. Data from the DONALD cohort of 24-hour urine samples (n=567) and 3-day weighted dietary records were used for external replication of results. Multivariate modelling with Unbiased Variable selection in R (MUVR) algorithms and linear mixed models were used to identify novel biomarkers. Metabolite features significantly associated with dietary intake were then annotated. In total, 66 metabolites were discovered and found to be statistically significant for ""chocolate candy"", ""cakes, puddings & cookies"", ""candy & sweets"", ""ice cream"", and ""crisps"". Most of the features (n=62) could not be annotated. Short-term and habitual chocolate intake were positively associated with theobromine, xanthosine, and cyclo(L-prolyl-L-valyl). These results were replicated in the DONALD cohort. Short-term ""candy & sweets"" intake was negatively associated with octenoylcarnitine. We identified potential metabolite biomarkers of sweet and fatty snacks in children, of which three biomarkers of chocolate intake, namely theobromine, xanthosine, and cyclo(L-prolyl-L-valyl) were externally replicated.

Specifically, propose a scoring system to identify patient populations who benefit from IVC filter placement. Single-institution retrospective cohort study between 2010-2022. Inclusion criteria were open posterior thoracolumbar fusion, ≥ 7 segments, and adult patients ≥ 18 years old. Patients undergoing any surgical approach other than posterior were excluded. Risk factors such as smoking status, illicit drug use/type, body mass index (BMI), gender, age, anticoagulation history and status on presence of PE were reviewed. 365 patients were identified; 170 (46.6%) patients were male, and 195 (53.4%) were female. 24 (6.6%) had IVC filters placed before the surgery. The overall rate of PE was 8 (2.2%), all in patients without IVC filter. Analysis showed that gender, age, and BMI did not affect incidence of PE. Smoking status, history of illicit drug use (cocaine/cannabis), and history of deep vein thrombosis/PE significantly increased the incidence of PE. Based on multivariate logistic regression, we developed a scoring system composed of aforementioned significant risk factors to determine risk of developing PE. Our scoring system stratified risk to low-risk (0-3 points), medium-risk (4-6 points), and high-risk (7-8 points). Risk of PE is relatively low after long-segment posterior thoracolumbar fusion. Smoking (former and current), history of cocaine/cannabis use, and history of venous thromboembolism are risk factors in such patients. We recommend prophylactic IVC filter use only in high-risk subgroups and under discretion between physician and patient in medium-risk subgroups.","Jonah Heidel, H Francis Farhadi, Ryan Hofler, R Carter Cassidy, Rouzbeh Motiei-Langroudi","World neurosurgery","2024Sep25",NA
"39332759","Correlation between osteoporosis and endplate damage in degenerative disc disease patients: a study based on phantom-less quantitative computed tomography and total endplate scores.","Osteoporosis and degenerative disc disease (DDD) are prevalent in the elderly population. Damage to the vertebral endplate, which impairs nutrient supply to the disc, serves as both a significant initiator and a hallmark of DDD. This study was aimed to explore the association between osteoporosis and endplate damage. This retrospective study included 205 patients with DDD who were treated at tianjin hospital from January 2019 to May 2023. We collected data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), phantom-less quantitative computed tomography (PL-QCT) values, and total endplate scores (TEPS). The average PL-QCT value of L1-L4 and TEPS were used to represent volumetric bone mineral density (v-BMD) and the degree of endplate damage, respectively. Based on the average PL-QCT value of L1 and L2, patients were divided into three groups: normal group (BMD > 120 mg/cm3), osteopenic group (80 mg/cm3 ≤ BMD ≤ 120 mg/cm3), and osteoporosis group (BMD < 80 mg/cm3). Multiple linear regression models were used to identify independent factors associated with endplate damage. The overall TEPS (4.3±1.3 vs 5.0±1.0 vs 5.9±1.5, p<0.01) and segment (L1/2-L4/5) TEPS (p<0.05) in each group showed significant difference (R=-0.5), increasing in order from normal group to osteoporosis group. A significant negative correlation was found between TEPS and PL-QCT values in overall and each segments (p<0.001). The PL-QCT values and age (p<0.05) were independent factors influencing endplate damage. There were significant differences in the average number of TEPS ≥7 segments per patient among the three groups, with 1.16, 0.41, and 0.2 segments/person from osteoporosis group to normal group. Our study showed a significant positive correlation between osteoporosis and endplate damage. Attention is warranted for patients with osteopenia to prevent progression to osteoporosis, potentially leading to exacerbated DDD. The management of patients with both DDD and osteoporosis necessitates comprehensive treatment strategies that address both the BMD and endplate aspects of these conditions.","Yiming Zhang, Yiming Dou, Yuanzhi Weng, Chao Chen, Qingqian Zhao, Wentao Wan, Hanming Bian, Ye Tian, Yang Liu, Shan Zhu, Zhi Wang, Xinlong Ma, Xinyu Liu, Weijia William Lu, Qiang Yang","World neurosurgery","2024Sep25",NA

Few long-term outcome studies exist on operative management of CN. A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze demographics, comorbidities, complications, and outcomes of operative management of CN. Patients were divided into two cohorts for analysis: limited surgical intervention (LSI) and reconstructive surgery (RS). Fifty-eight patients with CN treated surgically over 11 years were identified. Average follow-up was 46 months (range, 1 to 173 months). The mean age was 60.2 (range, 29 to 81) years, and the average body mass index was 34.3. Diabetes caused CN in 72.4% (42/58) of patients.

"39332693","Exploring tryptophan metabolism: The transition from disturbed balance to diagnostic and therapeutic potential in metabolic diseases.","The rapidly rising prevalence of metabolic diseases has turned them into an escalating global health concern. By producing or altering metabolic products, the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in maintaining human health and influencing disease development. These metabolites originate from the host itself or the external environment. In the system of interactions between microbes and the host, tryptophan (Trp) plays a central role in metabolic processes. As the amino acid in the human body that must be obtained through dietary intake, it is crucial for various physiological functions. Trp can be metabolized in the gut into three main products: The gut microbiota regulates the transformation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), kynurenine (Kyn), and various indole derivatives. It has been revealed that a substantial correlation exists between alterations in Trp metabolism and the initiation and progression of metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and atherosclerosis, but Trp metabolites have not been comprehensively reviewed in metabolic diseases. As such, this review summarizes and analyzes the latest research, emphasizing the importance of further studying Trp metabolism within the gut microbiota to understand and treat metabolic diseases. This carries potential significance for improving human health and may introduce new therapeutic strategies.","Zhizhong Luo, Yuqing Liu, Xin Wang, Faxin Fan, Zhenzhen Yang, Duosheng Luo","Biochemical pharmacology","2024Sep25",NA
"39332689","Bodily growth and the intervertebral disc: a longitudinal MRI study in healthy adolescents.","Low back pain (LBP) among children and adolescents is a growing global concern. Disc degeneration (DD) is considered a significant factor in the clinical symptom of LBP. Both LBP and DD become more prevalent as adolescents transition into emerging adulthood. However, the relationship between growth during the pubertal growth spurt and the morphology of lumbar discs has yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to assess the relationship between bodily growth during the pubertal growth spurt and the morphology of lumbar discs at age 18. This study was a prospective longitudinal cohort study. A randomly selected cohort of healthy children was examined at ages 8, 11 and 18. Participants with complete data sets (semi-structured interview, anthropometric measurements and lumbar spine MRI) at age 11 and 18 were included in this analysis (n=59). The morphological characteristics of lumbar discs were evaluated on MRI. Anthropometric measures including height, sitting height and weight were obtained to calculate the Body Surface Area (BSA) and the Body Mass Index (BMI). The morphology of the lumbar discs was evaluated on T2-weighted mid-sagittal MRI using the Pfirrmann classification. A disc with a Pfirrmann grade of 3 or higher was considered degenerated at age 18. The relationship between relative growth between ages 11 and 18 (adjusted to sex and baseline values) and DD at age 18 was assessed. To analyze the relationship between the relative increase in BSA and DD, the participants were categorized into three equal-sized categories (tertiles). For all other anthropometric measures, the analysis was based on the relative increase in each measure between ages 11 and 18. In the highest tertile of relative increase in BSA (≥43%), 76% of participants had at least one disc with a Pfirrmann grade 3 or higher at age 18 while only 10% and 21% of participants in the lowest and medium tertiles had DD, respectively. The sex- and baseline-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for DD at age 18 for every additional 10% increase in BSA was 1.08 (1.02 to 1.15). The sex- and baseline-adjusted OR (95% CI) for DD at age 18 was 10.5 (1.60 to 68.7) and 7.92 (1.19 to 52.72) with every additional 10% increase in height and sitting height, respectively. For every additional 10% increase in weight, the adjusted OR for DD at age 18 was 1.51 (1.12 to 2.04) and for BMI 1.05 (1.01 to 1.09). More relative growth between ages 11 and 18 is significantly associated with the occurrence of DD in emerging adulthood. Among the measures investigated, height and sitting height are non-modifiable. Maintaining an ideal body weight during the pubertal growth spurt may be beneficial for the health of the lumbar discs.","Teija Lund, Leena Ristolainen, Hannu Kautiainen, Martina Lohman, Dietrich Schlenzka","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society","2024Sep25",NA
"39332613","Poorer clinical outcomes after THA in patients with a spinal scoliotic deformity: a case-control study of 268 patients assessed with PROMS.","Spinal deformities can lead to specific complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA), such as functional leg length discrepancy due to a fixed pelvic obliquity, as well as an increased risk of prosthetic instability due to a lack of adaptive pelvic mobility, but these issues were not investigated in large comparative series. Therefore a retrospective case-control study was done aiming: 1) to analyze the impact of a preoperative scoliotic deformity on the functional outcomes of patients who underwent THA with a minimum 1-year follow-up, 2) to measure the prevalence of scoliosis in both the case and control groups 3) to screen other factors that may be correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients who underwent THA, including age, gender, Body Mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, primary THA etiology and postoperative complication occurrence. The presence of scoliosis would have a negative impact on THA outcomes as assessed by PROMs. A case-control study was conducted using prospectively collected data including 268 patients who underwent THA between January 2009 and December 2021 through a direct anterior approach by the same senior surgeon. Cases were identified based on a 1-year follow-up modified Harris Hip score (mHHS) lower than 81 while controls were defined as patients with an excellent 1-year follow-up mHHS score (equal to or higher than 81). Three controls were randomly matched with each case based on the surgery period. To assess the impact of a concurrent scoliosis on clinical outcomes, a mathematical univariate and multivariate logistic model was used, including other confounding factors (age, gender, ASA score, BMI, Complication occurrence, etiology), to calculate the adjusted odds-ratio. In the multivariate analysis, scoliosis was found to be a significant risk factor, with a three-fold higher adjusted odds-ratio of lower mHHS score (adjOR = 3.1; 95 CI:1.4-7, [p < 0.01]). The mean mHHS score was significantly lower in the scoliosis group compared to the non-scoliosis group (77 vs. 84 [p = 0.01]) as well as the mean Oxford Hip Score (36 vs. 43 [p < 0.001]). Among the other assessed risk factors, only the occurence of a postoperative complication was associated with an increased odds ratio of poorer mHHS scores (adjOR = 7.1; 95 CI: 2.78-18.24, [p < 0.001]). The prevalence of scoliosis in our practice was 19%. Given the prevalence of 19% found in our study, we recommend screening for scoliosis in all patients scheduled for THA. Our results indicate that patients who had scoliosis experienced lower PROMs scores compared to those who had not. Surgeons should consider delivering this information to patients who have scoliosis undergoing THA to mitigate patient dissatisfaction.

"39332610","Comparison of open and endoscopic techniques of isolated calcaneoplasty in the surgical treatment of insertional tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon.","Insertional Achilles tendinopathy (IAT) is primarily caused by mechanical overload. Running and obesity are major risk factors. Medical treatment is limited, and surgery, particularly calcaneoplasty, is sometimes necessary. However, the choice between an endoscopic and open approach remains controversial. This study is based on the hypothesis that endoscopic surgery would allow for better functional recovery with a faster return to sports activity compared to traditional open techniques. Our multicenter prospective study compared the outcomes of endoscopic (Endo) and open (Open) calcaneoplasty in patients with IAT resistant to medical treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the EFAS (daily life and sports) and VISA-AF scores. The radiological criteria studied were the calcaneal slope and the X/Y ratio. An MRI was used to quantify tendon involvement. Of the 85 patients included, 51 underwent endoscopic surgery, and 34 had open surgery. The two groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics. At 3 months postoperatively, significantly more patients had returned to sports in the Endo group (41.6% vs. 20.6% in the Open group; p = 0.004), and the EFAS sports score showed a significant difference in favor of the Endo group at 6 months postoperatively (9.3 vs. 5.7/16; p = 0.008). The results confirm faster recovery after endoscopic surgery, with comparable complication rates between the two approaches. However, long-term, the differences between the two techniques diminish, with similar functional outcomes at 12 months postoperatively. Endoscopic calcaneoplasty is a safe and effective option for the treatment of IAT. However, further studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results and assess recurrence rates.

Insulin also modified cognitive function, eating behaviour, and the stress response. Nonetheless, inconsistencies in study designs, dosages, and outcome measures necessitate standardized methodologies to better understand central insulin action. Taken together, insulin's ability to modify stress and fear, appetite and eating behaviour, and cognitive function in both healthy and diseased individuals highlight its potential in the therapeutic and mechanistic exploration of highly prevalent psychiatric, metabolic, and cognitive conditions like mood disorders, obesity, and Alzheimer's disease.","Aniqa Tabassum, Sebastian Badulescu, Evanka Singh, Renee Asoro, Roger S McIntyre, Kayla M Teopiz, Cristian-Daniel Llach, Hiya Shah, Rodrigo B Mansur","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","2024Sep25",NA
"39332500","ASSESSMENT OF 1-HOUR POST-LOAD PLASMA GLUCOSE, THE METABOLIC SYNDROME AND THE FINDRISC SCORE IN THE PREDICTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.","To compare the 1-hour post-load glucose (1h-PG) value of an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and the Finish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to predict T2DM. A cohort study conducted in patients addressed at a general hospital in Lima-Perú. Subjects with IFG performed an OGTT were followed up to seven years for T2DM development. The exposures variables were 1h-PG ≥ 155mg/dL, MetS, and a FINDRISC score ≥ 13 points, and the presence of T2DM was the outcome. The relative risk (RR), confidential interval (CI), and area under the curve (AUROC) were also estimated. Among 324 subjects with IFG, 218 completed the 7-years-follow-up. The mean age was 56.2 ±11.5 years-old, 64.0% were female and 63.8% were overweigh/obese. 36.8% had 1h-PG ≥ 155mg/dL and normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 66.8% had MetS and 64.5% FINDRISC ≥ 13 points. After 7 years, 21.1% of participants developed T2DM, 68.8% of them with 1h-PG ≥ 155mg/dL (p< 0.001), 62.2% with MetS (p= 0.013), and 67.9% with FINDRISC ≥ 13 (p= 0.68). After adjusting by age, sex and BMI, the RR were 3.52 (1.64-7.54; 95%CI), 1.81 (0.96-3.38; 95%CI) and 1.17 (0.51-2.70; 95%CI), for each exposure-variable, respectively. Also, the AUROC were 0.72 (0.60-0.83), 0.63 (0.51-0.75), and 0.51 (0.38-0.63) (p= 0.01), respectively. By performing an OGTT in IFG patients, an 1h-PG ≥ 155 mg/dL value may be helpful to predict T2DM at 7 years better than the use of MetS or FINDRISC score.","Juan Carlos Lizarzaburu-Robles, Alonso Garro-Mendiola, María Lazo-Porras, Alba Galdón Sanz-Pastor, Flor Vento, Oscar Lorenzo","Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists","2024Sep25",NA

Patients with T2DM from16 centers were recruited and underwent transient elastography examination for diagnosis of liver steatosis and fibrosis. Clinical information including diabetes status, serum lipids profiles, and inflammatory markers were collected. Potential risk factors of liver steatosis and fibrosis in lean (BMI＜23 kg/m2) and non-lean (BMI≥23 kg/m2) groups were analyzed. A total of 1762 patients were included. The prevalence of liver steatosis and fibrosis in lean group were 44.7% and 23.4%. Prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease were higher in lean patients compared to non-lean group. Lean patients with liver steatosis or fibrosis were older, had longer diabetes duration, lower levels of HOMA-IR and serum lipids. Body mass index (BMI), visceral fat area (VFA) and triglyceride were among the most significant correlators of liver steatosis for both non-lean and lean patients. However, lipid profiles were different between two groups. Besides, insulin resistance, BMI and lipid levels were not observed to be associated with fibrosis in lean group. Liver steatosis and fibrosis in lean patients with T2DM were less associated with insulin resistance. Risk factors of liver steatosis were different between lean and non-lean patients, indicating the necessity of risk stratification and tailored management strategies.","Weixia Sun, Yingqi Lv, Li Wang, Hekai Yu, He Yi, Yifan Wang, Jing Han, Yingzhao Liu, Congqing Miao, Jie Li, Yan Zhang, Mengying Wang, Lei Chen, Stephen J Pandol, Ling Li","Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists","2024Sep25",NA
"39332498","REVIEW ARTICLE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH ACROMEGALY: An Update.","The most common causes of increased cardiovascular mortality in acromegaly are due to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Acromegalic cardiomyopathy, is defined as concentric biventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction when other cardiac diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and arrhythmias related cardiac disorders have been excluded. This also contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. The main risk factors contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy include advancing age, disease duration and body mass index (BMI). The duration of GH excess rather than the degree of hormone elevation is more closely associated with the development of biventricular enlargement, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and valvular disease. Additionally, other cardiovascular disorders such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart diseases, systemic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and rarely congestive cardiac failure are also involved in the shortened life span of these patients especially if poorly controlled. Biochemical control of acromegaly with the recently available multimodal treatment along with better management of cardiovascular co-morbidities has improved the morbidity and mortality rates of patients with acromegaly. However, with the recent advances in the treatment of acromegaly neoplastic causes presently remain as the main leading cause of death in these patients.","Rinsha Pv Sherin, Nicole O Vietor, Aqueel Usman, Thanh D Hoang, Mohamed Km Shakir","Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists","2024Sep25",NA
"39332488","Unveiling the intricate dance: Obesity and TNBC connection examined.","Amid the dynamic field of cancer research, various targeted therapies have proven crucial in combating breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer among women globally. Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) stands out from other types of breast cancer due to the absence of three key receptors on the cell surface (progesterone, estrogen, and HER2). Researchers are working on finding ways to address TNBC's elusive biomarkers and minimize the damage caused by the disease through treatments like chemotherapies and targeted pathway receptors. One connection that should receive more attention is the link between TNBC and obesity. Obesity is defined as consuming significantly more energy than is expended, resulting in a high BMI. Moreover, obesity fosters a cancer-friendly environment characterized by inflammation, elevated levels of hormones, proteins, and signaling that activate pathways promoting cancer. Non-Hispanic black women have experienced notable disparities in TNBC rates. Various factors have led to the higher incidence and poorer outcomes of TNBC in non-Hispanic black women. This detailed review explores the complex relationship between obesity and TNBC, examining how the two disorders are connected in terms of disparities and offering a glimpse into future research and interventions.","Patrick A Newport-Ratiu, Kamel Abou Hussein, Teralyn Carter, Shoghag Panjarian, Subash C Jonnalagadda, Manoj K Pandey","Life sciences","2024Sep25",NA
"39332350","Prenatal black carbon exposure and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood.","Prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in childhood. We previously observed that prenatal black carbon (BC) was inversely associated with adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes, in early childhood. Changes to DNA methylation have been proposed as a potential mediator linking in utero exposures to lasting health impacts. Among 532 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Colorado-based Healthy Start study, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of the relationship between prenatal exposure to a component of air pollution, BC, and DNA methylation in cord blood. Average pregnancy ambient BC was estimated at the mother's residence using a spatiotemporal prediction model. DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array. We used multiple linear regression to estimate associations between prenatal ambient BC and 429,246 cysteine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs), adjusting for potential confounders. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using DMRff and ENmix-combp. In a subset of participants (n = 243), we investigated DNA methylation as a potential mediator of the association between prenatal ambient BC and lower adiponectin in childhood. We identified 44 CpGs associated with average prenatal ambient BC after correcting for multiple testing. Several genes annotated to the top CpGs had reported functions in the immune system. There were 24 DMRs identified by both DMRff and ENmix-combp. One CpG (cg01123250), located on chromosome 2 and annotated to the UNC80 gene, was found to mediate approximately 20% of the effect of prenatal BC on childhood adiponectin, though the confidence interval was wide (95% CI: 3, 84). Prenatal BC was associated with DNA methylation in cord blood at several sites and regions in the genome. DNA methylation may partially mediate associations between prenatal BC and childhood cardiometabolic outcomes.","Chloe Friedman, Sierra Niemiec, Dana Dabelea, Katerina Kechris, Ivana V Yang, John L Adgate, Deborah H Glueck, Sheena E Martenies, Sheryl Magzamen, Anne P Starling","International journal of hygiene and environmental health","2024Sep26",NA
"39332263","Decreased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis with semaglutide and tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes or obesity with a history of acute pancreatitis: A propensity matched global federated TriNetX database-based retrospective cohort study.","Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a significant health concern with potential for recurrent episodes and serious complications. The risk of recurrence in type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity can be influenced by various factors and treatments, including GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This study evaluates the risk of recurrent AP among patients with a history of the condition, focusing on the effects of different GLP-1RA treatments. Our objective is to compare the recurrence risks of AP between patients treated with different GLP-1RAs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX platform, encompassing 258,238 individuals with T2D or obesity who have a history of AP. We assessed the recurrence of AP over a five-year period, analyzing data on treatment regimens, with a focus on the use of Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, and other GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RA users experienced significantly lower recurrence rates of AP, with those without risk factors showing GLP-1RA users had a recurrence rate of 13.8 % compared to 40.9 % for non-users. Semaglutide and Tirzepatide showed the most favorable outcomes; Semaglutide users had lower recurrence rates than Exenatide (10.1 % vs. 27 %) and slightly lower than Dulaglutide (13.6 % vs. 15.4 %), though not statistically significant with Dulaglutide. Tirzepatide users displayed the lowest recurrence risk at 6.2 %, significantly lower than those on Semaglutide (11.7 %). GLP-1RAs, particularly Semaglutide and Tirzepatide, are associated with a reduced risk of recurrent AP in people with T2D or obesity.

"39332195","The prevalent trajectory of early menopause associated with PM2.5 exposure across 1956-2018 extrapolated from LightGBM algorithm.","Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is noxious to female reproductive development and facilitates the occurrence of subsequent diseases. Early menopause is initiative factor of female aging. But due to the lack of historical exposure of PM2.5, we could not gain insight into the linkage between ambient PM2.5 exposure and early menopause. We conducted a community-based retrospective cross-sectional study and pooled 1173 postmenopausal women. The machine learning algorithm of LightGBM was processed to derive the historical concentrations of PM2.5 based on aerography of 1956-2022. The quantile g-computation and binary logistic regression were employed to estimate the mixed and single associations between PM2.5 and early menopause. The visibility topped the most important feature for derivations of historical PM2.5 concentrations. The R2 of 10-fold cross-validation and predictive capability during processing were all above 0.8. The prevalence of early menopause was 7.3 %. Each 10 µg/m3 PM2.5 increased the prevalence of early menopause during prior 2 years exposure (OR: 1.49, 95 %CI: 1.03-2.16) and spring and autumn (OR: 1.28, 95 %CI: 1.07-1.54). After adjusting the reverse effects of temperature, the prior 2 years exposure of PM2.5 remained positively associated with early menopause in the fourth quantile vs the first quantile (OR: 3.36, 95 %CI: 1.53-7.36) in the spring and autumn. The higher BMI (OR: 1.40, 95 %CI: 1.14-1.72), waistline (OR: 1.42, 95 %CI: 1.09-1.85) and unfavourable dietary habits of less meat (OR: 1.72, 95 %CI: 1.11-2.68), more fried food (OR: 2.39, 95 %CI: 1.15-4.99) elevated the prevalence of early menopause. The accurate environmental exposure assessment of historical PM2.5 vigorously promoted the researches on the relationship between PM2.5 and early menopause.

Although fatty composition can assist in diagnosis through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, the latter cannot exclude local infiltration. CLs are distributed evenly between both sexes and can be located anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract; however, they are more frequently located in the colon, particularly in the right colon and cecum (39.6%), followed by the transverse colon (25%), descending colon (20.8%), and the sigmoid colon (14.6%). Symptoms included abdominal pain (79.2%), alterations in bowel habits (45.8%), rectal bleeding (22.9%), colocolic intussusception (50%), weight loss (6.2%), vomiting (14.6%), and nausea (12.5%). Surgical and endoscopic techniques are widely used to manage CLs. The challenge for physicians is differentiating this lesion from malignant colonic lesions, at the outset.

Linear mixed models and Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed to assess temporal changes in bone mass and linear regression analysis to assess the associations between possible risk factors and bone loss. DXA results revealed that substantial annual bone loss occurred in the total hip site up to 3 years postinjury and in the femoral neck site up to 2 years postinjury. Old age, women, and low body mass index were significant risk factors for bone loss in the SCI population. Additionally, during the chronic phase, lower Korean Spinal Cord Independence Measure 3rd edition scores were associated with low bone mass. Significant annual bone loss in the hip region persists for up to 3 years postinjury in individuals with SCI.

Mendelian randomization is an instrumental variable analysis method that follows Mendel genetic law of random allocation of parental alleles to offspring. In observational studies, genetic variants are used as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between exposure factors and study outcomes. All the genome-wide association study data in our study were publicly available and from published genome-wide association studies, UK Biobank, and FinnGen. Random-effects inverse variance weighted was the primary analysis method, with R Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode as supplementary methods. We examined heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and the influence of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms on the analysis. We further explored the causal relationships between BMI, T1D, urolithiasis, and hydronephrosis, as well as the robustness of the analysis results. Inverse variance weighted results showed genetic causal relationships between BMI (P = .034, odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.273 [1.019-1.589]), T1D (P = .028, OR 95% CI = 0.921 [0.855-0.991]), urolithiasis (P < .001, OR 95% CI = 1.361 [1.175-1.576]), and hydronephrosis.

"39331863","The causal association between type 2 diabetes and spinal stenosis: A Mendelian randomization analysis.","Spinal stenosis is a prevalent degenerative spinal disease and one of the main causes of pain and dysfunction in older adults. Substantial evidence indicates a potentially relevant association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and spinal stenosis. However, the causality between these 2 disorders remains unclear. Therefore, we intended to elucidate this relationship using Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis in this study. Based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on T2DM and spinal stenosis, we performed a bidirectional 2-sample MR analysis to evaluate the causality of T2DM and spinal stenosis. We assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's Q statistic and horizontal pleiotropy using the MR-Egger-intercept. ""Leave-one-out"" analysis was performed to determine the reliability of causal relationships. In addition, we conducted multivariate MR to clarify the direct influence of T2DM on spinal stenosis after accounting for the effect of body mass index (BMI) on spinal stenosis. Our results indicated that Individuals with T2DM had a heightened risk of spinal stenosis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.050; 95% CI: 1.004-1.098, P = .031). Moreover, no reverse causality existed between T2DM and spinal stenosis. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that causality is steady and robust. Multivariate MR results demonstrated that the causality of T2DM on spinal stenosis was not related to BMI (OR, 1.047; 95% CI: 1.003-1.093; P = .032). MR analyses demonstrated a possible positive causal relationship between T2DM and spinal stenosis and that this causality was unrelated to BMI.","Zhaopeng Fan, Bohong Chen, Le Ding, Hua Guo","Medicine","2024Sep27","Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Spinal Stenosis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Body Mass Index; Risk Factors; Male; Causality; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"
"39331800","Trends of Overactive Bladder and Pharmacologic Treatment Among U.S. Women.","To evaluate and consider how prescribing practices have changed in relation to high-risk overactive bladder (OAB) medications. The objective of this study was to evaluate trends in the prevalence of OAB and pharmacologic treatment over time in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2001-2018, n = 30,478) and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS, 2003-2019, n = 251,330) were used to identify women with symptomatic incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB) (NHANES) as well as determine the frequency of prescription use for OAB medications (NHANES and NAMCS) using sampling-based weights. Joinpoint regression was used to determine adjusted annual percent change (APC, adjusting for race, age, body mass index, and insurance status). Trends were assessed overall and by race, age, body mass index, and insurance status. The prevalence of OAB was 31.2% in the final survey year of NHANES (2017-2018). Women aged >65 years had the highest prevalence of OAB at 54% compared with other age groups. There was an overall increase in OAB (APC 1.24 [0.64, 1.84], P = 0.002) over time. Overall, only 3.5% of patients with symptoms of OAB reported pharmacologic treatment in NHANES. The NAMCS demonstrated a significant decrease in anticholinergic prescriptions from 2003 until 2019 (APC -6.44 [-9.77, -2.98], P = 0.001). However, in NHANES, there was no significant change in anticholinergic use (APC 0.62 [-20.2, 26.8], P = 0.944). There was a stable prevalence of β3-adrenergic agonist prescriptions since they were introduced to market (APC 0.65 [-2.24, 3.62], P = 0.616). This study demonstrates an increasing prevalence of OAB and highlights the likely undertreatment of symptomatic patients. The high and increasing prevalence coupled with the relative undertreatment of OAB underscores the importance of screening for this condition.","Lauren A King, Jessica E Pruszynski, Clifford Y Wai, Maria E Florian-Rodriguez","Urogynecology (Philadelphia, Pa.)","2024Sep19",NA
"39331797","Prolapse Treatment-Related Decisional Conflict After New Patient Visits.","Patients with pelvic organ prolapse are often tasked with deciding between treatments. Decisional conflict is a measure of factors that go into effective decision making. This study aimed to compare prolapse treatment-related decisional conflict reported by underrepresented patients (URPs) to non-URPs after new patient visits. A multicenter cohort study of new patients counseled regarding management of prolapse from July 2021 to December 2022 was performed. Participants completed the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a validated measure of modifiable factors in decision making. Higher scores indicate feeling less comfortable with decisions. Race and ethnicity were viewed as social constructs. A URP was defined as self-identification with a non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity. Alpha was set at 0.05, power 80%, to detect an effect size of 0.4 between mean DCS scores. A total of 207 participants (103 URPs, 49.8%), with a mean age of 63.4 ± 11.9 years and mean body mass index of 29.7 ± 6.9 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), completed the study. Much of the URP group self-identified as Hispanic (50/103, 48.5%) and/or Black (39/103, 37.9%), and 30 of 103 (29.1%) had an interpreter at their visit. A greater proportion of non-URPs had a prior hysterectomy (16.1% difference; P = 0.017) and prolapse surgery (18/204, 10.5% difference; P = 0.020). A greater proportion of URPs had hypertension (23.6% difference; P = <0.001). There were no differences in the other pelvic floor disorders, prolapse stage, or treatments selected (all P > 0.05). The mean DCS scores were not different between groups (URP, 12.9 ± 12.3 vs non-URP, 11.6 ± 14.9; P = 0.31).

"39331749","A Comparative Analysis of Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Free Tissue Transfer, Partial Foot Amputation, and Below-Knee Amputation in High-Risk Limb Salvage Patients.","The surgical decision for limb-salvage with free tissue transfer (FTT), partial foot amputation (PFA), or below-knee amputation (BKA) for complex lower extremity (LE) wounds hinges on several factors, including patient choice and baseline function. However, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) on LE function, pain, and QoL for chronic LE wound interventions are limited. Thus, the study aim was to compare PROMs in patients who underwent FTT, PFA, or BKA for chronic LE wounds. PROMs were collected via QR code for all adult chronic LE wound patients who presented to a tertiary wound center between June 2022 and June 2023. A cross-sectional analysis of patients who underwent FTT, PFA, or BKA was conducted. The 12-Item Short Survey (SF-12), PROM Information System Pain Intensity (PROMIS-3a), and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) were completed at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1, 3, and 5 years postoperatively. Patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative characteristics, and amputation details were collected. Of 200 survey sets, 71 (35.5%) underwent FTT, 51 (25.5%) underwent PFA, and 78 (39.0%) underwent BKA. Median postoperative time points of survey completion between FTT (6.2 months, IQR: 23.1), PFA (6.8 months, IQR: 15.5), and BKA (11.1 months, IQR: 21.3) patients were comparable (P = 0.8672). Most patients were male (n = 92, 76.0%) with an average age and body mass index (BMI) of 61.8 ± 12.6 years and 30.3 ± 7.0 kg/m2, respectively. Comorbidities for FTT, PFA, and BKA patients included diabetes mellitus (DM; 60.6% vs 84.2% vs 69.2%; P = 0.165), peripheral vascular disease (PVD; 48.5% vs 47.4% vs 42.3%; P = 0.790), and chronic kidney disease (CKD; 12.1% vs 42.1% vs 30.8%; P = 0.084). No significant differences were observed between FTT, PFA, and BKA patients in mean overall PROMIS-3a T-scores (49.6 ± 14.8 vs 54.2 ± 11.8 vs 49.6 ± 13.7; P = 0.098), LEFS scores (37.5 ± 18.0 vs 34.6 ± 18.3 vs 38.5 ± 19.4; P = 0.457), or SF-12 scores (29.6 ± 4.1 vs 29.5 ± 2.9 vs 29.0 ± 4.0; P = 0.298).

In this cross-sectional survey (2019-2020), we recorded anthropometry of 2,089 girls and boys between 13 and 17 years from semi-urban schools in western India. Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) was used for multidimensional attitudinal assessment of body image and weight-related variables. The Stunkard scale was used to assess body shape perception. In higher age categories, boys were more satisfied with their appearance (p=0.012, p linearity=0.001), cared more about grooming (p=0.007, p linearity=0.001), and regarded themselves more physically fit (p=0.003, p linearity 0.030 up to 16 years). Boys with normal BMI were more satisfied with their appearance (p=0.001), fitness (p=0.024), and more alert about symptoms of illness (p<0.000) than others. With increasing BMI, older girls and boys were more preoccupied with their weight and perceived themselves to be heavier (p=0.001). A majority of underweight girls perceived their weight as normal. Students engaged in weight loss practices irrespective of their BMI category. Boys wanted a bigger, and girls a smaller body shape than their current shape. We found body shape dissatisfaction in 66.4 % adolescents, more in boys than in girls (p=0.001). Body shape dissatisfaction is quite common among semiurban adolescents, with boys outnumbering girls.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between moderate/severe periodontitis and sUA in US adults. A total of 3398 participants were included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2009 to 2014. The independent variable was sUA and the dependent variable was periodontitis. SUA for continuous variables, periodontitis as classification variables. Covariate including social demographic variables, life style, systemic diseases, etc. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the distribution of differences in covariates between different independent groups. To investigate the association between serum uric acid levels and moderate/severe periodontitis, three models were used (Model 1: unadjusted model; Model 2: adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity; Model 3: adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, household income/poverty ratio, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, dental floss frequency, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, and sleep disorders). Among the 3398 patients, 42.5% had moderate/severe periodontitis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sUA was significantly associated with moderate/severe periodontitis (OR = 1.10, 95%CI: (1.03, 1.16), P = 0.0020) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In addition, it may vary by race/ethnicity and gender. The association between sUA levels and the prevalence ofperiodontitis was U-shaped in women and non-Hispanic blacks. sUA level is associated with moderate to severe periodontitis. However, the association between sUA levels and the occurrence of periodontitis in women and non-Hispanic blacks followed a U-shaped curve. sUA may directly or indirectly contribute to the global burden of periodontal disease, but there is little evidence that sUA is directly related to periodontitis.This study further supports that high uric acid levels are closely related to periodontitis and may contribute to the control of periodontitis. It also provides new insights into whether it can be used as an indicator to assess the risk or progression of periodontitis. More studies are needed to confirm the relationship between sUA and periodontitis.","Jingjing Bai, Chenying Zhou, Ye Liu, Ming Ding, Zhonghua Zhang, Zhu Chen, Ping Feng, Jukun Song","PloS one","2024","Humans; Periodontitis; Female; Uric Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Nutrition Surveys; Aged; Risk Factors; United States"

As fentanyl has replaced heroin in the drug supply, case reports and surveys have indicated increased concern for buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal (PW); however, some observational studies have found a low incidence of PW. To estimate buprenorphine PW incidence and assess factors associated with PW among emergency department (ED) or hospitalized patients. This retrospective cohort study at 3 academic hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, included adults with OUD who underwent traditional or high-dose buprenorphine initiation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Exclusion criteria included low-dose buprenorphine initiation and missing documentation of opioid withdrawal severity within 4 hours of receiving buprenorphine. Buprenorphine initiation with an initial dose of at least 2 mg of sublingual buprenorphine after a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 8 or higher. Additional exposures included 4 predefined factors potentially associated with PW: severity of opioid withdrawal before buprenorphine (COWS score of 8-12 vs ≥13), initial buprenorphine dose (2 vs 4 or ≥8 mg), body mass index (BMI) (<25 vs 25 to <30 or ≥30; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and urine fentanyl concentration (0 to <20 vs 20 to <200 or ≥200 ng/mL). The main outcome was PW incidence, defined as a 5-point or greater increase in COWS score from immediately before to within 4 hours after buprenorphine initiation. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of PW associated with the 4 aforementioned predefined factors. The cohort included 226 patients (150 [66.4%] male; mean [SD] age, 38.6 [10.8] years). Overall, 26 patients (11.5%) met criteria for PW. Among patients with PW, median change in COWS score was 9 points (IQR, 6-13 points). Of 123 patients with confirmed fentanyl use, 20 (16.3%) had PW. In unadjusted and adjusted models, BMI of 30 or greater compared with less than 25 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.12; 95% CI, 1.31-19.92) and urine fentanyl concentration of 200 ng/mL or greater compared with less than 20 ng/mL (AOR, 8.37; 95% CI, 1.60-43.89) were associated with PW. In this retrospective cohort study, 11.5% of patients developed PW after buprenorphine initiation in ED or hospital settings.

Retrospective study of 429 consecutive patients receiving liver transplantation from 1/1/2010 to 31/12/2015. Final cohort included 366 patients. Electronic radiological images (lateral views of spine X-rays or Scout CT abdominal scans) performed within 6 months from LT, were blinded reviewed to screen for morphometric vertebral fractures. Symptomatic clinical fragility fractures were recorded from the medical records. Patients with fragility fractures in the cohort were 155/366 (42.3%), with no significant differences between sexes. Most sustained vertebral fractures (145/155, 93.5%), mild or moderate wedges, with severe fractures more frequently observed in women. Multiple vertebral fractures were common (41.3%). Fracture rates were similar across different etiologies of cirrhosis and independent of diabetes or glucocorticoids exposure. Kidney function was significantly worse in women with fractures.

"39331227","Position statement of Italian Society of Obesity (SIO): Gestational Obesity.","Gestational obesity (GO) presents a multifaceted challenge to maternal and fetal health, with an escalating prevalence and far-reaching consequences extending beyond pregnancy. This perspective statement by the Italian Society of Obesity (SIO) provides current insights into the diagnosis, maternal and fetal impacts, and treatment strategies for managing this pressing condition. This article provides a comprehensive review of the maternal and fetal effects of GO and provides suggestions on strategies for management. Comprehensive review was carried out using the MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. The diagnosis of GO primarily relies on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), although standardized criteria remain contentious. Anthropometric measures and body composition assessments offer valuable insights into the metabolic implications of GO. Women with GO are predisposed to several health complications, which are attributed to mechanisms such as inflammation and insulin resistance. Offspring of women with GO face heightened risks of perinatal complications and long-term metabolic disorders, indicating intergenerational transmission of obesity-related effects. While nutritional interventions are a cornerstone of management, their efficacy in mitigating complications warrants further investigation. Additionally, while pharmacological interventions have been explored in other contexts, evidence on their safety and efficacy specifically for GO remains lacking, necessitating further investigation. GO significantly impacts maternal and fetal health, contributing to both immediate and long-term complications. Effective management requires a multifaceted approach, including precise diagnostic criteria, personalized nutritional interventions, and potential pharmacological treatments. These findings underscore the need for individualized care strategies and further research to optimize outcomes for mothers and their offspring are needed. Enhanced understanding and management of GO can help mitigate its intergenerational effects, improving public health outcomes.

We identified nine BMI change groups based on three BMI status: underweight (BMI <  18.5 kg/m2), normal or overweight (18.5 kg/m2≤BMI <  25 kg/m2), and obese (BMI≥25 kg/m2). Of 20,703 individuals, 3,789 (18.0%) died during the follow-up period. Excessive weight loss to underweight in the obese group (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.36, 95% CI:1.60-7.08), weight loss in the normal to overweight group (HR = 2.04, 95% CI:1.75-2.39), sustained underweight status (HR = 2.05, 95% CI:1.67-2.52), and weight gain from underweight to normal or overweight (HR = 1.52, 95% CI:1.15-2.02) were associated with increased mortality. Sustained obese status (HR = 0.80, 95% CI:0.74-0.87) and weight gain in the normal to overweight group (HR = 0.82, 95% CI:0.71-0.95) were associated with reduced mortality. We found that BMI change at diagnosis was associated with mortality in patients with PD. Specifically, being underweight either before or after diagnosis as well as experiencing weight loss, were associated with increased mortality. These findings provide valuable insights for weight management planning in PD, highlighting the importance of individualized approach that consider pre-diagnosis BMI.","Seo Yeon Yoon, Ja Young Choi, Ga Eun Nam, Jin-Hyung Jung, Kyungdo Han, Sung Hoon Kang, Chi Kyung Kim, Yong Wook Kim, Seong-Beom Koh","Journal of Parkinson's disease","2024Sep25",NA

Evaluation for undernutrition by subjective global nutritional assessment and for PEW using paediatric criteria was undertaken and categorized as mild (>2 criteria), standard (>3 criteria) and modified PEW (>3 criteria with short stature). The IRHA (severe viral, bacterial or fungal infections) were recorded. Among 137 children (45 on dialysis; age 123 ± 46 months; 70% males), undernutrition was seen in 60% and PEW in 52%. In over 38 ± 21 months follow-up, 107 (78%) required hospital admissions (67% IRHA).

On adjusted analysis, independent risk factors for IRHA were undernutrition, low BMI, hypoalbuminemia and dialysis status with modified PEW [OR 5.34 (2.16, 13.1) p < 0.001] and raised CRP [OR 4.66 (1.56, 13.9) p = 0.006] having the highest risk. Additionally, modified PEW and BMI were noted to have a twofold risk for recurrent infections. In children with CKD2-5D, incidence rate of IRHA was significantly higher in those with undernutrition and PEW.

To evaluate preoperative and postoperative weight trends for patients undergoing primary THA and factors associated with clinically significant weight change. A prospective cohort who underwent primary unilateral THA (n= 3,011) at a tertiary healthcare system (January 2016 to December 2019) were included in the study. The primary outcomes were clinically significant weight change (> 5% change in body mass index [BMI]) during the one-year preoperative and one-year postoperative periods. Preoperatively, 66.6% maintained a stable weight, 16.0% gained and 17.4% lost weight, respectively. Postoperatively, 64.0% maintained a stable weight, while 22.6% gained and 13.4% lost weight, respectively. Female sex, Black race, obesity, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and older age were associated with preoperative weight loss. Female sex, obesity, higher CCI scores, and Medicare insurance were associated with postoperative weight loss. Preoperative weight loss was associated with postoperative weight gain (OR = 3.37 [CI: 2.67 to 4.25]; p< 0.001), and preoperative weight gain was associated with postoperative weight loss (OR = 1.74 [CI: 1.30 to 2.3]; p< 0.001). Most patients maintained a stable BMI one-year before and one-year after THA. Several factors are associated with weight loss before and after THA.

Sex can serve as an influencing factor, leading to variations in the factors affecting HTN. This study aimed to investigate gender and sex differences in the prevalence of HTN and explore the associations between HTN and 4 categories of risk factors: demographics, habits or lifestyle, body measurement, and laboratory blood results among non-Hispanic Asians in the United States. This secondary analysis included non-Hispanic Asian adults aged 18 years or older from the 2017 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Among the 815 participants, 35% of men (140 of 399) and 37% (154 of 416) of women had HTN (P = .610). The mean age for men is 46.03 ± 16.9 years, whereas the mean age for women is 49.24 ± 16.8 years. After regression analysis, advancing age, increased body mass index, and increased serum uric acid were significant predictors of HTN in both sexes. However, men developed HTN earlier compared with women. Marital status and increased fasting glucose were only significant in men. Compared with their never-married counterparts, men who were currently married or living with a partner had lower odds of having HTN (odds ratio, 0.28; P = .034). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of HTN between the sexes. Age, body mass index, and serum uric acid were significant risk factors in both men and women.

"39330722","Menstrual Dysfunction in Adolescent Female Athletes.","Despite the benefits of exercise on mental and physical health, excessive training loads can lead to health problems in the long term, including a wide spectrum of menstrual dysfunction (MD). This narrative review aims to analyze the relationship between physical exercise and MD in adolescent female athletes to support regular menstrual health monitoring and promote educational programs on reproductive risks. When dealing with MD in young athletes, several factors entangled with maturation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis should be considered. Firstly, some disciplines seem to have a higher prevalence of MD due to the high loads of training regimes and the early introduction of athletes to a competitive career. Moreover, low energy intake and a low body mass index appear to exacerbate existing MD. Lastly, disordered eating behaviors and psychological stress can contribute to MD in female athletes. The type of sport, influencing the intensity and duration of exercise, as well as individual psycho-physiological and environmental factors, may influence the role of physical activity in the manifestation of MD. Early recognition and management of MD, along with collaboration between sports organizations and health professionals, are crucial to minimize risks, ensure proper nutrition, and balance training with recovery. Keeping an open discussion on the topic may prospectively improve awareness, early diagnosis, and treatment strategies, as well as reduce injury risk and enhance sports performance.","Valeria Calcaterra, Matteo Vandoni, Alice Bianchi, Agnese Pirazzi, Lara Tiranini, Paola Baldassarre, Marianna Diotti, Caterina Cavallo, Rossella Elena Nappi, Gianvincenzo Zuccotti","Sports (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep04",NA

This study explores the associations of school-level factors and school sports facility parameters with overweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study across seven random districts in Punjab province, Pakistan, was conducted using a representative multistage random cluster sample. Underweight (BMI < 5th percentile), overweight (85th ≤ BMI < 95th percentile), and obese (95th percentile ≤ BMI) were defined using the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2000 criteria. Statistical analyses including the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression were performed to investigate predictive characteristics. Logistic regression analysis assessed the simultaneous impact of several covariates on dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) computed and a significance level set at p < 0.05. The study included 4108 Pakistani school children aged 9 to 17 years (mean age = 13.92 years, 59.3% boys) from 62 schools. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 19.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Findings revealed a concerning lack of physical education activities (60% reported 0 sessions per week), morning exercise (60%), and classroom exercises (66%) among school-aged children. Leadership attitudes toward physical education (β = 0.04, p = 0.006) and students' satisfaction with the playground (β = 0.05, p = 0.015) showed significant associations with body weight status. Conversely, provision of physical education facilities, effective fund utilization for physical education, meeting school sports facility requirements, and weekend opening of school sports grounds did not significantly impact weight status. Satisfaction with the playground was significantly associated with a lower risk of overweight (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, p < 0.05), indicating reduced overweight likelihood among students satisfied with school playgrounds. The study underscores significant gaps in promoting physical activity within school environments and highlights the urgent need for interventions to enhance physical education resources and sports facilities, aiming to create healthier school environments and reduce overweight and obesity prevalence among students. Further research and interventions are crucial for promoting lifelong physical activity habits and improving student health and well-being.","Moazzam Tanveer, Ejaz Asghar, Georgian Badicu, Umar Tanveer, Nadeem Roy, Asifa Zeba, Sameer Badri Al-Mhanna, Alexios Batrakoulis","Sports (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Aug28",NA
"39330515","Understanding the Genetic Landscape of Gestational Diabetes: Insights into the Causes and Consequences of Elevated Glucose Levels in Pregnancy.","Background/Objectives: During pregnancy, physiological changes in maternal circulating glucose levels and its metabolism are essential to meet maternal and fetal energy demands. Major changes in glucose metabolism occur throughout pregnancy and consist of higher insulin resistance and a compensatory increase in insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. For some women, this change is insufficient to maintain normoglycemia, leading to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a condition characterized by maternal glucose intolerance and hyperglycaemia first diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. GDM is diagnosed in approximately 14.0% of pregnancies globally, and it is often associated with short- and long-term adverse health outcomes in both mothers and offspring. Although recent studies have highlighted the role of genetic determinants in the development of GDM, research in this area is still lacking, hindering the development of prevention and treatment strategies. Methods: In this paper, we review recent advances in the understanding of genetic determinants of GDM and glycaemic traits during pregnancy. Results/Conclusions: Our review highlights the need for further collaborative efforts as well as larger and more diverse genotyped pregnancy cohorts to deepen our understanding of the genetic aetiology of GDM, address research gaps, and further improve diagnostic and treatment strategies.","Caroline Brito Nunes, Maria Carolina Borges, Rachel M Freathy, Deborah A Lawlor, Elisabeth Qvigstad, David M Evans, Gunn-Helen Moen","Metabolites","2024Sep20",NA
"39330498","Sarcosine, Trigonelline and Phenylalanine as Urinary Metabolites Related to Visceral Fat in Overweight and Obesity.","The objective of the present study is to analyze the urinary metabolome profile of patients with obesity and overweight and relate it to different obesity profiles. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study in which patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m were selected. Anthropometric data were assessed by physical examination and body composition was obtained by bioimpedance (basal metabolic rate, body fat percentile, skeletal muscle mass, gross fat mass and visceral fat). Urine was collected for metabolomic analysis. Patients were classified according to abdominal circumference measurements between 81 and 93, 94 and 104, and >104 cm; visceral fat up to 16 kilos and less than; and fat percentiles of <36%, 36-46% and >46%. Spectral alignment of urinary metabolite signals and bioinformatic analysis were carried out to select the metabolites that stood out. NMR spectrometry was used to detect and quantify the main urinary metabolites and to compare the groups. Seventy-five patients were included, with a mean age of 38.3 years, and 72% females. The urinary metabolomic profile showed no differences in BMI, abdominal circumference and percentage of body fat. Higher concentrations of trigonelline (p = 0.0488), sarcosine (p = 0.0350) and phenylalanine (p = 0.0488) were associated with patients with visceral fat over 16 kg. The cutoff points obtained by the ROC curves were able to accurately differentiate between patients according to the amount of visceral fat: sarcosine 0.043 mg/mL; trigonelline 0.068 mg/mL and phenylalanine 0.204 mg/mL. In conclusion, higher visceral fat was associated with urinary levels of metabolites such as sarcosine, related to insulin resistance; trigonelline, related to muscle mass and strength; and phenylalanine, related to glucose metabolism and abdominal fat. Trigonelline, sarcosine and phenylalanine play significant roles in regulating energy balance and metabolic pathways essential for controlling obesity. Our findings could represent an interesting option for the non-invasive estimation of visceral fat through biomarkers related to alterations in metabolic pathways involved in the pathophysiology of obesity.","Aline Maria Cavalcante Gurgel, Aline Lidiane Batista, Diogo Manuel Lopes de Paiva Cavalcanti, Alviclér Magalhães, Denise Engelbrecht Zantut-Wittmann","Metabolites","2024Sep10",NA

We performed a longitudinal observational cohort study to analyse long-term outcomes of Aspergillus colonization and ABPA in children with CF. Anonymised UK CF Registry data from 2009 to 2019 for patients aged 8-17 years in 2009-2010 were collected. For the baseline cohort analysis, patients were classified based on the presence of Aspergillus colonization and ABPA in 2009 and/or 2010. For the longitudinal analysis, patients were categorised according to annual Aspergillus colonization and ABPA status. Comparisons made were (1) Aspergillus positive vs. negative; (2) excluding those with ABPA: Aspergillus positive vs. negative; and (3) ABPA positive vs. negative. Primary outcome was percentage predicted FEV1 decline and secondary outcomes included BMI decline, mortality, lung transplant, and IV antibiotic use. Of the 1675 children, 263 had Aspergillus colonization in the baseline cohort, 260 were diagnosed with ABPA, and 80 had both. Baseline cohort analysis showed significantly lower lung function (p < 0.0001) and increased antibiotic treatment (p < 0.001) in those with Aspergillus colonization and in those with ABPA. Longitudinal analysis showed ABPA was associated with increased decline in lung function (p < 0.00001) and BMI (p < 0.00001). Aspergillus colonization was associated with increased decline in BMI (p = 0.005) but not lung function (p = 0.30). ABPA was associated with increased decline in long-term lung function and BMI in children and young people with CF.

Our study aimed to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and treatment of patients with resistant HTN. We screened 4340 consecutive cardiovascular patients hospitalized in our clinic and identified 3762 with HTN. Of them, 128 fulfilled criteria for resistant HTN and were included in our study. We matched these patients to 128 hospitalized patients with controlled HTN. Resistant HTN patients comprised 3.4% of all hypertensive individuals. Most of these patients (67.2%) were at high or very high cardiovascular risk compared to controlled HTN patients (40.6%); p < 0001. Resistant HTN patients more commonly had concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) (60.9%), overweight/obesity (52.3%), dyslipidemias (35.2%), smoking (27.3%), and diabetes (21.9%) compared to controlled HTN patients (37.5%, 29.7%, 28.1%, 14.1%, and 7.8%, respectively); p < 0.001. Regression analysis showed the strongest association of resistant HTN with CKD (OR 6.64), stage III HTN (OR 3.07), and obesity/overweight (OR 2.60). In contrast, single-pill combinations (SPCs) were associated with a lower likelihood of uncontrolled HTN (OR 0.58). Resistant HTN represented a small proportion of all hypertensives in our study, but it was characterized by high/very high cardiovascular risk.

"39330326","Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Adults Aged 40 to 79 Years with Diagnosed Hypertension, High Cholesterol, and/or Diabetes but Not on Medications: Findings from Nationwide Cross-Sectional Studies.","Many people with diagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes are not receiving drug treatment, partly because they perceive their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as low. This study aimed to quantify the risk for future CVD events, either first or recurrent, in people with diagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes but not on medications for any of these conditions. Participants aged 40-79 years who had been diagnosed with hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes but were not on medications were identified from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys cycles 1999 to 2018. Among them, those with known CVD and those without known CVD but with complete data for estimating their 10-year CVD risk were included in this study. The participants were classified as (1) ""high-risk"" if they had known CVD or a 10-year predicted CVD risk ≥ 7.5% or (2) ""low-risk"" if they had a 10-year predicted CVD risk < 7.5%. Of the 5187 participants included, 2201 had known major CVD (n = 490, 9.45%) or a 10-year predicted CVD risk ≥ 7.5% (n = 1711, 32.99%), corresponding to a weighted proportion of 34.83% (95% CI: 33.15 to 36.51%) in the US general population. The proportions of high-risk participants were much higher in the elderly (65.50% for 60-69 years and 97.86% for 70-79 years), males (45.13%), and non-Hispanic Blacks (42.15%) than in others (all p < 0.001). These patterns were consistent across survey cycles during 1999-2018. Additional analyses that classified the participants into groups above or below the treatment threshold (rather than high- or low-risk groups) according to current guidelines yielded similar results. A comparison of the 2201 untreated high-risk participants with other participants who had been diagnosed with hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes and were on medications for these conditions showed that ""lower BMI"", ""smaller waist circumference"", and a ""non-diabetic"" status, among others, were associated with a higher likelihood of ""not taking medications"". In conclusion, approximately one-third of the US adults aged 40 to 79 years with diagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or diabetes but not on medications had known CVD or a 10-year predicted CVD risk ≥ 7.5%, and this proportion was little changed over the past two decades. Interventions targeted at the subgroups with particular characteristics identified in this study may help improve the management of CVD and its risk factors.","Shuting Wang, Yanji Qu, Jiayue Zhang, Xue Xue, Zuyao Yang","Journal of cardiovascular development and disease","2024Aug29",NA

This prospective, longitudinal study assesses associations between baseline characteristics and PROs after treatment. Herein, we report the baseline clinical characteristics and PROs prior to treatment initiation. Outcomes post-treatment over time will be reported separately. Patients with planned surgery for EC were prospectively enrolled in 2019-2021 and administered the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ EC Module (EN24), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and the Mayo Clinic lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) questionnaire. This study enrolled 198 patients with a mean (SD) age of 63.6 (9.8) years and body mass index of 35.5 (8.3) kg/m2. No significant differences in the PROs for the QOL were seen when compared to the reference means (SD) except for the lower interest in sexual activity (31.9 (9.8) vs. 47.5 (SE0.70)) and lower fatigue (21.3 (19.8) vs. 31.7 (25.9)). Increased obesity was associated with an increased likelihood of LEL (p < 0.01) and multiple QOL scales, including poorer global health status (p < 0.01) and physical functioning (p < 0.01). Prior to treatment initiation for EC, the patients had a similar QOL compared to that of the general population. The patients with increasing obesity, a known risk factor for EC, had worse overall global health status and physical functioning. A better understanding of these QOL measures is imperative for earlier identification and intervention of patients at risk of chronic impairments from EC treatment.","Simrit Warring, Kathleen J Yost, Andrea L Cheville, Sean C Dowdy, Stephanie S Faubion, Amanika Kumar, Maureen A Lemens, Chelsie C Van Oort, Angela J Fought, Michaela E Mc Gree, Andrea Mariani, Gretchen Glaser","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)","2024Sep17","Humans; Female; Quality of Life; Endometrial Neoplasms; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cancer Survivors"

Baseline PS, alb, CRP, mGPS (modified Glasgow prognostic score), and BMI were analyzed using Cox regression. Adjusted for age, sex, and hospital size, PS ≥ 2 and alb < 35 g/L predicted shorter survival in both PAN and GI cancers, while CRP > 10 predicted shorter survival only in GI cancers. In PAN, PS ≥ 2 predicted a 78.4% higher probability of shorter survival, and mGPS 2 predicted a 68.7% higher probability. In GI, mGPS 2 predicted a 70.8% higher probability, whereas PS was not significant. BMI did not improve predictive models.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical variables that affect HRQOL and its domains in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at a tertiary cancer center in India. Baseline clinical features, treatment details, and completed Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), composed of FACT-general (FACT-G) and prostate cancer-specific concerns subscale (PCS) and FACT-P Trial Outcome Index (FACT-P TOI) questionnaires, were collected. The mean total, as well as individual domain scores, were calculated. Additionally, these were stratified by the current treatment being received by patients. Linear regression was used to identify independent factors affecting HRQOL in these patients. Of the 106 enrolled patients, 84 completed the FACT-P questionnaire and were included in the analysis. The median age was 66 years, and at the time of assessment, 3 patients (3.6%) were receiving androgen deprivation therapy only, 53 patients (63.1%) were on ADT + androgen receptor-targeted agents (ARTAs), and 18 patients (21.4%) patients received ADT + chemotherapy. The mean (±standard deviation) of the FACT-P TOI score was 70.33 (±15.16); the PCS subscale was the most affected, followed by functional well-being. Patients on chemotherapy scored significantly higher on PCS, but the composite scores were not significantly different. Univariable regression identified obesity (body mass index > 25 kg/m2) and duration of first-line treatment as significant predictors of better HRQOL; however, obesity was the only independent predictor in multivariable analysis (β = 8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 15.0; p = 0.022). Obesity also independently predicted a better FACT-P and its physical well-being domain score and PCS.

Current treatments, particularly Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), face adherence challenges, necessitating novel therapeutic approaches. Methods: This review explores the potential of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), commonly used for type 2 diabetes and obesity, in managing OSA. GLP-1RA promotes weight loss, enhances insulin sensitivity, and exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, potentially addressing key pathophysiological aspects of OSA. Results: Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may reduce OSA severity by decreasing upper airway fat deposition and improving respiratory control. Clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and improvements in sleep quality with GLP-1 therapy. Conclusions: Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying GLP-1 effects on OSAS, optimizing combination therapies, and identifying patient subgroups that may benefit the most. Integrating GLP-1RA into OSAS management could revolutionize treatment by addressing both the metabolic and respiratory components of the disorder, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.","Silvano Dragonieri, Andrea Portacci, Vitaliano Nicola Quaranta, Pierluigi Carratu, Zsofia Lazar, Giovanna Elisiana Carpagnano, Andras Bikov","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","2024Sep23",NA

In this cross-sectional study, 275 participants were enrolled by systematic sampling at the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected by using a pretested semi-structured standard questionnaire for QoL (OPQOL-35). Pearson's correlation was used to assess the association between QoL and sociodemographic factors. Multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify predictors of QoL, after controlling for potential confounders. The median age of the participants (n = 275) was 65 years (range, 60 to 85; 25th and 75th percentile, 60 and 68, respectively). The majority (78%) of them were married, and 20% were widowed or divorced. The median score of QoL was 113 (25th and 75th percentile, 101 and 124, respectively). Most of the participants had very poor (bad as can be) or poor (bad) QoL. Only 7.3% were observed to have ""good"" QoL (scores 140 or more).

"39329102","Echotexture of recurrent laryngeal nerves: the depiction of recurrent laryngeal nerves at high-frequency ultrasound during radical thyroidectomy.","To investigate the ultrasound characteristics of recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) during radical surgery for thyroid cancer and to enhance the understanding of RLN ultrasound features. From October 2021 to December 2022, a prospective study was conducted involving 24 patients scheduled for bilateral thyroid surgery. Near the conclusion of the surgery, intraoperative ultrasonography of the RLN within the tracheoesophageal groove was performed using a 15-7 MHz transducer. The thickness and width of the RLN were measured during the procedure. The internal architecture of the RLN was observed to consist of multiple hypoechoic, parallel, but discontinuous linear hyperechoic areas separated by bands. In the normal RLN group, the diameter of the RLN was relatively consistent, with thickness ranging from 2.20 to 2.71 mm (mean: 2.48 ± 0.14 mm) and width from 1.25 to 1.70 mm (mean: 1.45 ± 0.11 mm). Both weight and the body mass index (BMI) showed a statistically significant correlation with RLN thickness (Weight: r=0.544, P=0.001; BMI: r=0.605, P=0.001). The BMI also showed a statistically significant correlation with the RLN width (r=0.377, P=0.033). In the RLN invasion group, the width of invaded RLNs ranged from 1.9 to 2.3 mm (mean: 2.10 ± 0.11 mm), while the width of non-invaded RLNs ranged from 2.6 to 3.2 mm (mean: 2.93 ± 0.20 mm). Ultrasound effectively reveals the structural features of the RLN and enhances sonographers' understanding of RLN characteristics.","Ziyue Hu, Man Lu, Zirui Jiang, Xu Wang, Wei Yang, Yuting Fan, Tingting Li, Lu Wang, Ting Wei, Quan Dai","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Thyroidectomy; Female; Male; Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve; Middle Aged; Ultrasonography; Prospective Studies; Adult; Thyroid Neoplasms; Aged; Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injuries"
"39329036","Estimation of Serum Malondialdehyde (a Marker of Oxidative Stress) as a Predictive Biomarker for the Severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Cardiovascular Outcomes.","Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is influenced by oxidative stress, which is a critical yet often overlooked factor in disease progression. While traditional biomarkers such as cholesterol levels and blood pressure are commonly used, they do not fully capture oxidative damage. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, offers additional insights into oxidative stress and CAD severity. Unlike conventional markers, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which primarily reflects lipid levels, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which indicates inflammation, MDA directly measures oxidative damage. This makes MDA a potentially valuable complement to these traditional biomarkers, providing a more nuanced understanding of CAD risk. Despite its potential, the role of MDA in clinical assessments remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating MDA's effectiveness as a complementary biomarker, enhancing the assessment of CAD risk and progression beyond what is provided by existing markers. Objective This study aims to assess serum MDA levels in relation to CAD severity to explore its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for disease progression and cardiovascular outcomes. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology, Mardan Medical Complex Teaching Hospital, Pakistan, from June 2023 to May 2024. Patients were divided into different groups with varying severity of CAD. The one-way ANOVA was used to assess differences among groups, and Pearson's correlation coefficient explored relationships between MDA and all study variables. Simple linear regression analyzed associations between MDA levels, patient groups, and other variables, controlling for covariates. MDA's potential as a predictive biomarker was assessed through ROC curve analysis, with statistical significance set at a p-value < 0.05. Results A total of 133 patients were included in the study, categorized based on CAD severity into mild (n=71), moderate (n=39), and severe (n=23) groups. Serum MDA levels significantly increased with the severity of CAD. Specifically, MDA levels were 116.61 ± 41.95 in the mild group, 253.45 ± 180.29 in the moderate group, and peaked at 459.91 ± 149.80 in the severe group. The differences in MDA levels among these groups were statistically significant (p < 0.01), supporting the association between higher MDA levels and increased CAD severity. Factors such as BMI, heart rate, blood pressure, and smoking status also significantly influenced MDA levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of MDA for assessing CAD severity, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.81 for moderate and 0.94 for severe CAD. Comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated MDA levels. Conclusion Elevated serum MDA serves as a reliable, non-invasive biomarker for predicting CAD severity, with potential applications in clinical risk assessment and management strategies. By identifying patients with elevated oxidative stress early, clinicians can implement timely interventions, potentially slowing disease progression and improving outcomes.","NA Asfandiyar, Noorul Hadi, Imran Ali Zaidi, Zeeshan Kamal, NA Ashraf, Rizwan Ullah Khan, NA Rumman, Mohammad Hashim Khan, Fatima Omair","Cureus","2024Sep",NA
"39328999","Establishing age- and sex-specific anthropometric growth references standards for South Punjab adolescents utilizing the LMS method: findings from the Pakistani population.","The physical health of adolescents is crucial for the prosperity and sustainable development of a nation. Developing specific growth standards is essential for prioritizing the wellbeing of the youth of Pakistan. This study aimed to establish normative standards for height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) among 12- to 16-year-olds in South Punjab, facilitating accurate health assessments and tailored interventions. This study utilized a cross-sectional design and stratified random sampling to select 2,970 adolescents (49.73% boys and 50.26% girls) aged 12-16 years from South Punjab, Pakistan. Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and BMI, were collected. The data were stratified by age and sex, and smoothed percentile curves were computed using the LMS method, which incorporates the L (γ-lambda), M (μ-mu), and S (δ-sigma) parameters. The results were compared to international references to provide a comprehensive analysis. The results highlight sex-specific trends in anthropometric indicators among adolescents. Boys exhibited higher mean values in height (160.50 ± 11.50 cm), weight (45.02 ± 9.78 kg), and BMI (17.30 ± 2.41) than girls (158.57 ± 9.34 cm, 41.00 ± 7.89 kg, and 16.29 ± 2.82, respectively). Growth patterns indicate boys grow faster in height and weight between ages 12 and 14, whereas girls show slower annual increases. Comparative analysis with international standards reveals that boys' height and weight were generally lower than international medians (P50th), whereas girls' height was comparable or higher. BMI values for both sexes were lower than international norms, reflecting unique regional growth patterns. This research establishes updated age- and sex-specific normative reference standards for adolescents in South Punjab, Pakistan. The study revealed that Pakistani adolescent boys exhibit higher mean values in height, weight, and BMI than girls, with faster growth rates between ages 12 and 14. Compared to international standards, Pakistani adolescents show lower BMI values, highlighting unique regional growth patterns. These standards have practical applications in screening, monitoring, and health strategy planning, contributing to efforts to promote a healthier future for the population. Future studies are recommended to utilize these local growth references for health surveillance and treatment in the local population.","Liu Long, Syed Danish Hamdani, Syed Muhammad Zeeshan Haider Hamdani, Jie Zhuang, Haris Khurram, Syed Ghufran Hadier","Frontiers in public health","2024","Humans; Adolescent; Pakistan; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Child; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Anthropometry; Body Height; Sex Factors; Age Factors; Reference Values; Reference Standards"
"39328998","Low hand grip strength as an indicator of depression in the Korean population: a large-scale cross-sectional study.","Depression is one of the leading global mental health problems, and hand grip strength (HGS) is associated with depression. However, there have been no studies assessing the association between depression and relative HGS indices combined with waist circumference (WC) and the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The objective of this study was to examine the association of depression with absolute and relative HGS indices. This was a cross-sectional study based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2019. A total of 20,649 participants (8,959 men, 43.4% and 11,690 women, 56.6%) were included. The associations between depression and the HGS indices were analyzed through complex sample binary logistic regression models, which were adjusted for age in Model 1 and various covariates in Model 2. The prevalence of depression was 4.58%, with rates of 2.29% for men and 6.34% for women. The prevalence of depression in women was 2.76 times greater than that in men. In men, the mean HGS values in the dominant hand were 35.48 ± 0.75 kg in the depression group and 38.73 ± 0.11 kg in the non-depression group; in women, they were 21.37 ± 0.22 kg in the depression group and 22.77 ± 0.07 kg in the non-depression group. In men, relative HGS indices as HGS/WC, HGS/body mass index, and HGS/WHtR were more strongly associated with depression than were the absolute HGS indices; however, in women, the associations were similar for both absolute and relative HGS indices. The magnitude of the association was greater for men than for women. In both sexes, all the anthropometric indices had a lower association with depression than did the HGS indices. Low absolute and relative HGS were negatively associated with depression in the Korean population. But, relative HGS indices were more strongly associated with depression than were absolute HGS and anthropometric indices in men but not in women.","Bum Ju Lee","Frontiers in public health","2024","Humans; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Republic of Korea; Hand Strength; Depression; Middle Aged; Adult; Nutrition Surveys; Prevalence; Waist Circumference; Aged"
"39328995","Double burden of malnutrition among women and children in Zimbabwe: a pooled logistic regression and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis.","The double burden of malnutrition (DBM) is a public health issue characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition within the same population, household, or individual. Undernutrition, manifesting as stunting, wasting, or being underweight, results from insufficient nutrient intake while overnutrition, manifesting as overweight or obesity, results from excessive caloric intake, poor diet quality, and sedentary lifestyles. This dual burden poses significant challenges for health systems due to lost productivity and increased healthcare expenditure. This study utilised data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Zimbabwe for 2010-2011 and 2015, which provided information on women's and children's health and nutritional status, household characteristics, and socio-economic status. Pooled logistic regression was used to analyse the association between various sociodemographic factors and DBM among women and children. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method explored differences in DBM between 2010-2011 and 2015. The average age of mothers was approximately 31 years, and children's ages averaged around 32 months. From 2010 to 2015, there was a notable socio-economic improvement, with a decrease in the percentage of mothers in the poorest quartile from 20 to 16% and an increase in the richest quartile from 22 to 23%. The study found a slight decrease in overall household DBM among women from 34% in 2010 to 32% in 2015, while DBM among children increased from 12 to 14%. Pooled logistic regression analysis indicated that children in rural areas had statistically significantly higher odds of experiencing DBM than their urban counterparts. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition showed that changes in residence status significantly impacted the increase in DBM among children. At the same time, the coefficient effect accounted for most of the unexplained differences in DBM among women. The growing DBM among women and children in Zimbabwe is significantly influenced by changes in residence status. The findings highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to address urban-rural disparities and emphasise the importance of considering socio-economic, environmental, and behavioural factors. Context-specific public health strategies, aligned with WHO's Double Duty Actions, are essential to improve the nutritional health of Zimbabwe's population.","Akim Tafadzwa Lukwa, Plaxcedes Chiwire, Folahanmi Tomiwa Akinsolu, Denis Okova, Charles Hongoro","Frontiers in public health","2024","Humans; Female; Zimbabwe; Adult; Logistic Models; Child, Preschool; Malnutrition; Male; Nutritional Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Infant; Health Surveys; Adolescent; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Child"

However, there is a lack of evidence on associations between between diet and these metabolites. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between dietary nitrate/nitrite and gut microbial metabolites (TMAO, KYN) on MetS and its components. This cross-sectional study included 250 adults aged 20-50 years. Dietary intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), and serum TMAO and KYN levels were measured. MetS was defined usingthe National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III) criteria. The ATPIII index revealed an 11% prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the study participants. After adjusting for confounders, significant positive interactions were found: High animal-source nitrate intake and high TMAO levels with elevated triglycerides (TG) (p interaction = 0.07) and abdominal obesity (p interaction = 0.08). High animal-source nitrate intake and high KYN levels with increased TG (p interaction = 0.01) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (p interaction = 0.01).Individuals with high animal-source nitrite intake and high TMAO levels showed increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.35-2.87, p = 0.05), hypertension (OR: 1.53, 95%CI: 0.33-2.58, p = 0.06), and lower HDL (OR: 1.96, 95%CI: 0.42-2.03, p = 0.04). Similarly, high animal-source nitrite intake with high KYN levels showed lower HDL (OR: 2.44, 95%CI: 1.92-3.89, p = 0.07) and increased risk of hypertension (OR: 2.17,95%CI: 1.69-3.40, p = 0.05). Conversely, Negative interactions were found between high plant-source nitrate/nitrite intake with high KYN and TMAO levels on MetS and some components. There is an interaction between dietary nitrate/nitrite source (animal vs. plant) and gut microbial metabolites (TMAO and KYN) on the risk of of MetS and its components.

Only a portion of patients ultimately undergo second-stage ACI/MACI. To identify patients with articular cartilage defects who underwent arthroscopic debridement with biopsy for ACI/MACI and compare those who did with those who did not proceed with implantation within 2 years after biopsy. Additionally, the authors sought to identify why patients did not proceed with implantation. Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Patients who underwent arthroscopy and autologous chondrocyte biopsy from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, and who had minimum 2-year follow-up data were grouped into those who proceeded with second-stage ACI/MACI (implant group; n = 97) and those who did not (biopsy group; n = 63). Demographic factors, cartilage defect characteristics, and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were analyzed. Patients in both groups were evaluated postoperatively using the IKDC, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and patients who did not undergo implantation were asked for their reasoning. Body mass index (BMI) (P < .001) and Outerbridge grades at index arthroscopy (P = .047) were significantly higher for the implant group than the biopsy group. Both groups had significantly improved IKDC scores from their initial presentation to final follow-up (implant group: 46.4 ± 16.2 preoperative vs 69.6 ± 20.6 postoperative [P < .001]; biopsy group: 47.2 ± 15.9 preoperative vs 70.7 ± 19.1 postoperative [P < .001]); however, the level of improvement did not differ significantly between groups. Postoperative WOMAC, SANE, and VAS pain scores were also similar between groups. In the biopsy group, 23 patients (37%) cited symptom resolution or activity level improvement after initial arthroscopy as the reason for not proceeding with implantation. Patients who proceeded to the second stage of chondrocyte implantation via either ACI or MACI had higher-grade articular defects and higher BMI compared with those who underwent biopsy with concomitant debridement chondroplasty alone.

"39328702","Incidence and Risk Factors of Arytenoid Dislocation Following Endotracheal Intubation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Endotracheal intubation carries risks, including arytenoid dislocation (AD), a rare but severe complication. Due to small sample sizes, the incidence of AD varies considerably among studies. Proposed risk factors for AD include difficult intubation, prolonged intubation, certain surgeries, patient positioning, female sex, and BMI. This review aims to investigate the incidence of AD and explore the various predisposing risk factors. We retrieved relevant studies up to April 2024 from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Using OpenMeta v5.26.14 software (Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, USA), we pooled AD incidence rates from individual studies. Other outcomes, reported in fewer studies and thus not suitable for meta-analysis, were synthesized manually. Study selection yielded 16 eligible articles. A random-effects model analysis of nine studies found a significant AD incidence rate of 0.093% (confidence interval (CI): 0.045% to 0.14%), but the results were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 91%). Older age was associated with prolonged hoarseness, while younger age and female sex increased the risk of AD. Additionally, AD risk factors included taller stature, higher BMI, specific surgeries, esophageal instrumentation, prolonged procedure durations, head-neck movement, and inexperienced intubators. However, intubation with a stylet reduced the AD risk. AD post-endotracheal intubation is rare (incidence: 0.09%), with potential underdiagnosis in larger datasets. Many risk factors may contribute to the condition, but the small number of studies per risk factor limits the ability to draw robust conclusions. Subjective diagnoses and retrospective studies further restrict comprehensive understanding. Further research is needed to explore AD risk factors effectively.","Nasser Saad Alalyani, Alhanouf Abdulaziz Alhedaithy, Hind Khaled Alshammari, Rafeef I AlHajress, Rakan H Alelyani, Malak Fawaz Alshammari, Abdullah Hassan Alhalafi, Amani Alharbi, Nada Aldabal","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

Consequently, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is of paramount importance for the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases. The lifestyle behaviors of healthcare workers exert a significant influence on their attitudes and counseling methods, as they play a pivotal role in the promotion of health and the dissemination of lifestyle education to patients and the general population. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of lifestyle factors among primary care physicians in Al-Ahsa Governorate, including smoking, body mass index, nutrition, physical activity, and caffeine consumption. Methods The study was conducted between December 2023 and February 2024. A total of 233 primary care physicians in Al-Ahsa were selected through a probability multistage clustering sampling method. Data were collected via the distribution of a self-administered questionnaire to the primary care physicians and were analyzed using the chi-square test. Results A greater proportion of primary care physicians exhibited multiple unhealthy lifestyle factors (166/233, 71.2%). The most prevalent lifestyle factor was low physical activity (169/233, 73%), followed by poor nutrition (121/233, 52%), obesity (120/233, 51.51%), smoking (37/233, 15.88%), and caffeine consumption (22/233, 9%). The majority of primary care physicians with optimal health status are employed in primary healthcare (PHC) facilities situated in the eastern region followed by the southern region in Al-Ahsa Governorate.

"39328587","Early puberty: a review on its role as a risk factor for metabolic and mental disorders.","Accumulating evidence indicates that there is a trend of early puberty onset in humans. The early timing of puberty has raised concerns due to its association with significant negative health outcomes. However, overall impact and potential risk of early puberty remain uncertain. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of existing epidemiological studies to gain insights into the long-term adverse health effects associated with early puberty. Our objective was to provide a consolidated summary of these outcomes at a population level by considering studies that encompass various indicators of puberty. In all, early puberty has been identified as a potential risk factor for various metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Children who experience early puberty are more likely to have a higher body mass index (BMI) during adulthood, increasing their risk of obesity. Early puberty also has been found to be an independent risk factor for diabetes mellitus, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as earlier onset of menarche in girls and voice breaking in boys is associated with a higher prevalence of T2DM. Furthermore, evidence suggests that early puberty may contribute to an elevated risk of CVD, including conditions like coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, angina, and hypertension. In addition, adolescents who experience early puberty, particularly girls, are more likely to suffer from mental problems, such as behavioral dysfunction and depression. Notably, early puberty has a more significant impact on girls than boys.

Appendicular muscle mass, assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and adjusted for body mass index, was used as a marker for sarcopenia. Dietary selenium intake was evaluated using the 24-h dietary recall system, and the study accounted for the complex sampling methodology and incorporated dietary sample weights in the analysis. Among the 19,696 participants, the prevalence of sarcopenia was found to be 8.46%. When compared to the lowest quintile of dietary selenium intake (Q1, < 80.10 μg/day), the odds ratios for sarcopenia in the second quintile (Q2, 80.10-124.61 μg/day) and the third quintile (Q3, >124.61 μg/day) were 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.92, p = 0.002] and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.51-0.73, p < 0.001), respectively. A negative relationship was observed between dietary selenium intake and sarcopenia (non-linear: p = 0.285). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses revealed a robust association between selenium intake and the prevalence of sarcopenia after further adjusting for blood selenium levels.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of a protein-supplemented very-low-calorie diet (PSVLCD) for weight reduction and changes in body composition in individuals with obesity over a 12-month long-term period. In total, 106 participants with obesity were randomly assigned to a PSVLCD or control group (food-based calorie-restricted diet). Body weight, waist circumference, body composition, and blood marker levels were measured throughout the study. Statistical analyses were performed to compare outcomes between the groups. Among the 106 participants, 84 completed the 12-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the mean weight loss from baseline to 12 months was -6.86 kg (8.21% of baseline weight) in the PSVLCD group and - 4.66 kg (5.47% of initial body weight) in the control group; the difference was -2.20 kg with a marginally significant interval (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.90; 0.50). Waist circumference (-8.35 cm vs. -4.85 cm; mean difference, -3.49 cm; 95% CI, -6.48 to -0.50) and visceral fat area (-28.28 cm2 vs. -13.26 cm2; mean difference, -15.03cm2; 95% CI, -29.01 to -1.04) also significantly decreased in the PSVLCD group at 12 months. The PSVLCD group demonstrated a substantial initial reduction in waist circumference that was sustained over the study period, alongside a marginally significant decrease in weight.

The CC and CWC groups demonstrated significant cognitive impairment on the WASI-Vocabulary test (CWC: 13.4 ± 2.2; CC: 15.9 ± 1.1) compared to the control group (Ct: 22.8 ± 1.6; p = 0.0002). In the QLQ-C30 scores, the CC group reported a greater perceived loss of quality of life and health deterioration (score of 17.5 ± 2.6) and lower scores on the Functional Scale (49.8 ± 4.5). The CC group had 18.52% illiteracy, 18.52% incomplete higher education, and 22.22% complete elementary education. The CC group also had lower weight (Ct: 67.8 ± 1.4; CWC: 61.7 ± 3.1; CC: 59.6 ± 1.7; p = 0.0023) and BMI (CC: 21.5 [18.3; 24.8]; Ct: 24.9 [23; 25.8]; p = 0.0021) compared to controls. Cytokines detected in the CSF were MCP-1, VEGF, IL-8, IP-10, and MIP-1β. Higher concentrations of MCP-1 were found in cancer patients (CSC: 571.2 ± 105.8; CC: 399.5 ± 65.9; Ct: 1477 ± 0.1; p < 0.0001), along with lower levels of MIP-1β (CC: 4345 [3060; 7353]) and VEGF (CC: 48.3 ± 2.0; CWC: 49.8 ± 3.8; Ct: 64.8 ± 3.2; p < 0.0001). The level of mental impairment (mood, anxiety, and cognitive deficits) correlated with cancer-associated and cachexia-associated inflammation, weight loss, low BMI, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low scores on the QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Global Health Status, Functional Scale, Symptom Scale). The CC group exhibited a higher prevalence of depression/anxiety, a stronger correlation between depression and inflammation, and greater cognitive impairment in attention, reasoning, and language, alongside lower average educational attainment. The low concentration of certain cytokines in the CSF combined with elevated systemic CRP in cancer and cachexia, associated with mental disorders, presents a paradox that requires further investigation. Higher concentrations of the cytokine MCP-1 in cancer patient groups indicated a positive correlation with the preservation of language abilities in these patients.","Gabriela Noronha Fortes, Marcos Fraga Fortes, Marcos Noronha Fortes, Fernanda Christoffel Gomes, Marília Cerqueira Leite Seelaendar, Ariene Murari Soares de Pinho, Joyce de Cassia Rosa de Jesus, José Pinhata Otoch","Journal of surgical oncology","2024Sep27",NA
"39328099","Assessment of Cardiopulmonary Fitness and Physical Activity in Health Science Students.","Background Insufficient physical activity and poor cardiopulmonary fitness increases the risk of chronic diseases and premature mortality. Sedentary lifestyle is observed among young health science students. Objective To assess cardiopulmonary fitness and physical activity levels among health science students at Jumla. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted on health science students at Karnali Academy, Jumla. Cardiopulmonary fitness was assessed using the Queen's College Step Test to calculate VO2max. International Physical Activity Questionnaire was applied to measure physical activity in terms of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) value. Data analysis utilized GNU-PSPP software with descriptive and inferential statistics. Result Total 107 students participated (56 females), aged 18-37 years. Their median VO2max was 40.05 ml/kg/min, significantly higher in males [51.69 (IQR 45.81 - 57.57)] than females [36.37 (IQR 34.90 - 38.58)] (p<0.001). Median weekly physical activity was 1030 MET-minutes/week, with males reporting higher levels [1436 (962 - 2670)] than females [678 (414 - 1103)] (p<0.001). VO2max had a positive correlation with total MET value per week (r = 0.504, p<0.001), and negative correlation with body adiposity (p<0.02). Multiple linear regression revealed physical activity level, sex, and BMI as significant predictors of VO2max (p<0.01). Conclusion Health science students at Karnali Academy have average levels of cardiopulmonary fitness and physical activity, lower in females. Targeted interventions can improve their fitness, benefiting the wider population in future. Further research should explore barriers to physical activity and factors influencing healthy lifestyle adoption among health science students in this region.","D B Pun, J P Jha, B P Magar, B Thapa","Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ)","2024Apr-Jun","Humans; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Exercise; Adult; Adolescent; Young Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Students; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Fitness; Sedentary Behavior"

Our study aimed to explore the potential relationship between the HEPAKID index and risk factors contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease in obese adolescents with metabolic syndrome. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study, conducted at two medical centers from December 2023 to March 2024, included 208 obese adolescents, with a median age of 14.5 years and an average body mass index (BMI) of 30.57 kg/m2. Results: Elevated HEPAKID index values were found in obese adolescents with metabolic syndrome, showing positive associations with BMI, waist and hip circumferences, alanine aminotransferase level, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance. In those with metabolic syndrome, waist circumference (WC) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were significant independent variables linked to the HEPAKID index, while WC was the sole influencer in the nonmetabolic syndrome group. Multivariate logistic regression highlighted systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the HEPAKID index as reliable predictors of metabolic syndrome. A predictive cutoff value of 60.84 for the HEPAKID index showed 61.7% sensitivity and 59.1% specificity in identifying metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: Our study highlighted the potential value of the HEPAKID index in combination with other clinical parameters for predicting metabolic syndrome in obese adolescents, underscoring its role as a valuable screening tool. Furthermore, our findings revealed a correlation between the HEPAKID index and insulin sensitivity in this high-risk population.","Sadiye Sert, Muammer Büyükinan, Ahmet Fatih Yılmaz","Metabolic syndrome and related disorders","2024Sep27",NA

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Clinical data were collected from 46 KD children with CAL who were hospitalized in the Cardiovascular Center of Children's Hospital of Fudan University between January 2021 and August 2022 and were treated with clopidogrel, including gender, age, body mass index, course of KD, CAL severity grade, and baseline platelet count. According to their age, the children were divided into ≥2-year-old group and <2-year-old group. Their platelet responsiveness was assessed by adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet inhibition rate (ADPi) calculated via thromboelastography, and children were categorized into high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) and normal on-treatment platelet reactivity (NTPR) groups. Genotypes of CYP2C19, PON1 and ABCB1 were detected. The t test, one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test were used for intergroup comparison. Results: Among the 46 KD children with CAL, 34 were male and 12 were female; 37 were ≥2-year-old and 9 were <2-year-old; 25 cases were in the HTPR group and 21 cases were in the NTPR group, with 19 HTPR and 18 NTPR in the ≥2-year-old group, and 6 HTPR and 3 NTPR in the <2-year-old group. Genetic analysis showed that 92 alleles among the 46 children, with frequencies of CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*17, PON1 192Q, PON1 192R, ABCB1 3435C, ABCB1 3435T at 59% (54/92), 32% (29/92), 9% (8/92), 1% (1/92), 36% (36/92), 64% (59/92), 63% (58/92) and 37% (34/92), respectively. Analysis of the impact of genotype on ADPi revealed that in children aged ≥2 years, those with CYP2C19*1/*3 genotype had significantly lower ADPi than those with CYP2C19*1/*1 genotype ((34±15)% vs. (61±29)%, t=2.18, P=0.036). There were also no significant difference in ADPi among children with PON1 192Q homozygous, PON1 192R heterozygote and PON1 192R homozygous genotypes ((40±22)% vs. (52±33)% vs. (65±27)%, F=2.17, P=0.130), or among those with ABCB1 3435C homozygous, ABCB1 3435T heterozygote and ABCB1 3435T homozygous genotypes ((55±34)% vs. (60±27)% vs. (49±24)%, F=0.33, P=0.719). In <2-year-old group, there were no significant differences in ADPi across CYP2C19*1/*1, CYP2C19*1/*2 and CYP2C19*2*2 genotypes ((40±20)% vs. (53±37)% vs. (34±16)%, F=0.37, P>0.05). There were no significant differences in ADPi across CYP2C19*1/*1 and CYP2C19*1/*3 genotypes ((44±27)% vs. (42±20)%, t=0.08, P>0.05). There were no significant differences in ADPi across PON1 192Q homozygous, PON1 192R heterozygote and PON1 192R homozygous genotypes (45% vs. (55±27)% vs. (24±5)%, F=1.83, P>0.05). There were no significant differences in ADPi across ABCB1 3435C homozygous, ABCB1 3435T heterozygote and ABCB1 3435T homozygous genotypes ((36±16)% vs. (50±35)% vs. 45%, F=0.29, P>0.05). The risk analysis of HTPR in different genotypes revealed that in children aged ≥2 years, carrying at least 1 or 2 loss-of-function alleles of CYP2C19 was a risk factor for HTPR (OR=4.69, 10.00, 95%CI 1.11-19.83, 0.84-119.32, P=0.033, 0.046, respectively), and PON1 192R homozygosity and carrying at least one PON1 192R allele were protective factors against HTPR (OR=0.08, 0.13, 95%CI 0.01-0.86, 0.01-1.19, P=0.019, 0.043, respectively).

Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the association between risk factors and mortality from chronic kidney disease. During the follow-up period, 373 participants (185 men and 188 women) died from chronic kidney disease. A body mass index of ≥27 kg/m2 (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 2.00 [1.19-3.36] for men and 1.91 [1.19-3.07] for women, compared with 23.0-24.9 kg/m2), a history of hypertension (2.32 [1.67-3.22] for men and 2.01 [1.44-2.81] for women) and a history of diabetes mellitus (5.21 [3.68-7.37] for men and 7.10 [4.93-10.24] for women) were associated with an increased risk of mortality from chronic kidney disease in both sexes. In men, smoking was also associated with an increased risk (1.91 [1.25-2.90]), while current drinking (0.58 [0.34-0.98] for <23 g/day, 0.48 [0.29-0.80] for 23-45 g/day and 0.53 [0.32-0.86] for ≥46 g/day) and exercising ≥5 hours/week (0.42 [0.18-0.96]) were associated with a lower risk. Similar but non-significant associations for smoking and drinking were observed in women.

We leveraged data on clinical risk factors for childhood obesity during the perinatal period, along with cord blood per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cord blood DNA methylation, in 268 mother-offspring pairs. We used the sparsity ranked LASSO penalized regression framework for each outcome and assessed model performance based on % variability explained for BMIz and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the fourth versus first quartile of %FM. We employed cross-validation for model tuning and split-sample validation for model evaluation. Mean ± SD BMIz was 0.01 ± 1.1, %FM was 19.8 ± 6.34%. The optimal model for predicting BMIz explained 19.1% of the variability in the validation set and included only clinical characteristics: maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, gestational weight gain, physical activity during pregnancy and child race/ethnicity. The optimal model for fourth versus first quartiles of %FM achieved an AUC of 0.82 ± 0.01 in the validation set, with the clinical features again emerging as the strongest predictors. In this study sample, perinatal chemical exposures and the epigenome have low utility in predicting childhood adiposity, beyond known clinical risk factors.","Jonathan VanHawkins, Ryan Peterson, Kylie Harrall, Brandy Moon, Dana Dabelea, Katerina Kechris, Wei Perng","Pediatric obesity","2024Sep26",NA
"39327826","Prevalence of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Women: Insights From the Houston HeartReach Study.","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. Past research has highlighted the importance of the relationship between female-specific demographics and traditional risk factors. The present analysis aimed to identify the prevalence of modifiable risk factors in women attending a community cardiovascular health screening. Data collected between 2011 and 2019 were obtained from the Houston HeartReach Registry. Participants were classified as having or not having each of 4 traditional cardiometabolic risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, body mass index indicating overweight or obesity, and dyslipidemia. Differences in prevalence were compared using the Pearson χ2 test. Most participants had hypertension, overweight or obesity, and dyslipidemia. Older women (≥65 years) had the highest prevalence of all cardiometabolic risk factors. Black participants had a higher prevalence of hypertension (P = .006) and a lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (P = .009) than non-Black participants. Hispanic participants had a lower prevalence of hypertension (P < .001) and a higher prevalence of overweight or obesity (P = .03) than non-Hispanic participants. Participants in the lowest household income bracket (<$25,000) were more likely to have diabetes (P = .001) and overweight or obesity (P = .004) than participants in the highest income bracket (≥$50,000). Unemployed participants had a higher prevalence of diabetes (P < .001), overweight or obesity (P = .004), and dyslipidemia (P < .001) than employed participants. Comorbidity analysis revealed clustering of multiple cardiometabolic risk factors. Moreover, risk factor hot spots were identified by zip code, which could help select future sites for targeted screening. The analysis found that cardiometabolic risk factor prevalence varies with demographic and socioeconomic status. Geographic areas where cardiometabolic risk factor prevalence was highest were also identified. Further participant recruitment and analysis are required to create predictive models of cardiovascular disease risk in women.","Arjun R Raghuram, Matthew W Segar, Stephanie Coulter, Joseph G Rogers","Texas Heart Institute journal","2024Sep27","Humans; Female; Prevalence; Middle Aged; Aged; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Texas; Adult; Dyslipidemias; Risk Assessment; Hypertension; Risk Factors; Retrospective Studies; Obesity; Registries"

However, there is no consensus on the optimal regimen for weight management in adults. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to January 15, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving adults, evaluating the weight-loss effects of alternate day fasting (ADF), short-term fasting (STF), time-restricted eating (TRE), and continuous energy restriction (CER). The primary outcome was body weight, with secondary outcomes including BMI, fat mass, lean mass, waist circumference, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and adverse events. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted, ranking regimens using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the probability of being the best. Study quality was assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis tool. Data from 47 RCTs (representing 3363 participants) were included. ADF showed the most significant body weight loss (Mean difference (MD): -3.42; 95% Confidence interval (CI): -4.28 to -2.55), followed by TRE (MD: -2.25; 95% CI: -2.92 to -1.59). STF (MD: -1.87; 95% CI: -3.32 to -0.56) and CER (MD: -1.59; 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.79) rank third and fourth, respectively. STF lead to decline in lean mass (MD: -1.26; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.47). TRE showed benefits on fasting glucose (MD: -2.98; 95% CI: -4.7, -1.26). Subgroup analysis revealed all four caloric restriction regimens likely lead to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, with ADF ranked highest, but by 4-6 months, varying degrees of weight regain occur, particularly with CER, while interventions lasting 7-12 months may result in effective weight loss, with TRE potentially ranking first during both the 4-6 months and 7-12 months periods. ADF showing fewer and shorter-lasting physical symptoms. All four included regiments were effective in reducing body weight, with ADF likely having the most significant impact. Each regimen likely leads to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, followed by weight regain by 4-6 months. However, interventions lasting 7-12 months achieve greater weight loss overall.

The data were obtained from a longitudinal study involving middle-aged and elderly populations in Dalian, China. The research encompassed individuals who exhibited typical uric acid levels initially and tracked their progress over a three-year period. 8 obesity indices were evaluated retrospectively. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify susceptible populations. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were utilized to model the dose-response relationships between obesity indices and HUA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to visualize and compare the predictive value of both traditional and new obesity indices for HUA. Among 4,112 individuals with normal baseline uric acid levels, 950 developed HUA. Significant associations with HUA were observed for body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), body roundness index (BRI), cardiometabolic index (CMI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and abdominal volume index (AVI). Subgroup analysis indicated that all obesity indices proved more effective in assessing the onset of HUA in women without Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Further analysis using RCS revealed non-linear dose-response relationships between LAP, CMI, VAI, and HUA in males, with similar non-linear relationships observed for all indices in females. The results from the ROC curves indicate that LAP may serve as a better predictor of HUA in males, and CVAI may serve as a better predictor in females. HUA is closely associated with obesity indices. Among females, CVAI emerges as the preferred predictive index for HUA. In males, LAP emerges as the preferred predictive index for HUA.","Yuntong Liu, Wei Zhao, Xuhan Liu, Haodong Jiang, Yixia Wu, Lan Luo, Zhengnan Gao","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep26","Humans; Hyperuricemia; Middle Aged; Male; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Obesity; Aged; Body Mass Index; Waist Circumference; Uric Acid; ROC Curve; China; Metabolic Syndrome; Retrospective Studies"

The presence of AVB was confirmed at an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading center using Minnesota ECG Classification. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to investigate potential risk factors of AVB, after adjustment for age, sex, race and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. During the 17 years of follow-up, a total of 731 high-degree AVB cases were identified. Age and sex-standardized rate of AVB was 2.79 and 2.35 per 1000 person-years in the white and the black population, respectively. With the increase of the geriatric population, the incidence of high-degree AVB will increase from 378,816 in 2020 to 535,076 in 2060, and most increment would occur among the elderly. Older age, male sex, the white race, overweight, comorbidities, declined forced vital capacity (FVC), elevated inflammation biomarkers, left bundle branch block and bifascicular block were independently associated with the incidence of high-degree AVB. To conclude, older age, male sex, white population, overweight, combined diabetes or chronic kidney disease, impaired FVC, elevated inflammation biomarkers, left bundle branch block and bifascicular block were independent predictors for high-degree AVB. The next 40 years would witness a dramatic increase in the incidence of high-degree AVB.","Jingwei Zhang, Jia Liu, Min Ye, Ming Zhang, Fengjuan Yao, Yunjiu Cheng","BMC cardiovascular disorders","2024Sep27","Humans; Male; Female; Atrioventricular Block; Incidence; Aged; Middle Aged; United States; Risk Assessment; Age Factors; Time Factors; Sex Factors; Comorbidity; Risk Factors; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Electrocardiography; Prospective Studies; White People; Aged, 80 and over"
"39327450","Adherence to long-term telemonitoring-supported physical activity in patients with chronic heart failure.","Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common diseases with a prevalence of 1-2% in adults, disproportionately affecting the elderly. Despite consistent drug therapy, physical activity (PA) is an integral part of current guidelines. Yet adherence to regular PA and exercise interventions is poor and potential predictors and barriers to PA remain elusive. We examined the effects of a telemonitoring-based exercise intervention in 699 CHF patients in a prospective, randomized-controlled (1:1), multicenter trial. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register under DRKS00019022 on 28.05.2020. For both, the exercise and control group, self-reported PA (MET*h/week) increased and sedentary behavior declined during the 12-month intervention period. In the exercise group, daily step count as analyzed via activity trackers remained stable (pre: 6459 [4016] steps/day, post: 6532 [3858] steps/day; p = 0.621). The average number of completed exercise instruction videos provided via an online application was 1.50 [1.44] videos/week at the beginning and gradually decreased to 1.00 [1.50] videos/week; p < 0.001). Multivariate regression model revealed that exercise-related PA (MET*h/week) and exercise capacity (Wmax) at baseline, CHF severity, atrial fibrillation and age predicted changes in self-reported exercise-related PA (R2 = 0.396). Furthermore, the BMI and the average number of completed videos per week at baseline were associated with the change in completed videos over the course of the study (R2 = 0.251). Our results show the influence of certain baseline characteristics as barriers and predictors of PA progression. Therefore, exercise programs should pay attention to patients' individual conditions to set achievable goals, and eventually affect the adherence and sustainability of exercise-focused interventions.","Pauline Lödding, Sebastian Beyer, Christoph Pökel, Momme Kück, Christian Leps, Lukas Radziwolek, Arno Kerling, Sven Haufe, Antina Schulze, Stefan Kwast, Johannes Voß, Christian Kubaile, Uwe Tegtbur, Martin Busse","Scientific reports","2024Sep26","Humans; Heart Failure; Male; Female; Aged; Exercise; Telemedicine; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Exercise Therapy; Prospective Studies; Chronic Disease"

Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for SSI were BMI (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.11; P = 0.004), smoking (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.12-3.19; P = 0.017), transverse diameter (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11; P = 0.017), component separation (OR = 1.996, 95% CI 1.25-3.08; P = 0.037) and clean-contaminated and contaminated surgeries(OR = 3.86, 95% CI 1.36-10.66; P = 0.009). Higher grades of Clavien-Dindo (P = 0.001) and mortality rates (P < 0.001) were found in the colorectal surgery group, although specific risk factors were detected. No differences were observed in terms of recurrence (P = 0.104). Concomitant surgery is related to greater risk of complications, especially in patients with comorbidities and complex hernias. In properly selected cases, simultaneous procedures can yield satisfactory results.","M Verdaguer-Tremolosa, V Rodrigues-Gonçalves, M P Martínez-López, J L Sánchez-García, M López-Cano, NA NA","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","2024Sep26",NA

In this cross-sectional study, records from primary care and hospitals were reviewed for patients aged 0-18 years who underwent serum folic acid testing. Data were retrieved from the Leumit-Health-Services database over a ten-year period (January 2008 to December 2018). Clinical and laboratory data were compared between patients with folic acid deficiency to those with normal levels. Among 20,411 pediatric patients tested, 884 (4.3%) had folic acid deficiency, of whom only 26.3% had anemia. Only two patients (0.2%) had megaloblastic anemia. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (odds ratio(OR)1.6, 95% CI 1.22-2.12), older age (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.26-1.39), higher BMI percentile (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.01), antipsychotic treatment (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.52-6.84), celiac (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.66-5.34), and Attention-Deficit-and-Hyperactivity-Disease (ADHD) treated with psychostimulants (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.56-3.12) were associated with folic acid deficiency(all p < 0.01). Lower hemoglobin levels were independently associated with increased OR of folic acid deficiency (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90, p = 0.001), but anemia as a diagnosis was not. Pediatric folic acid deficiency rates were low in this nationwide cohort and not linked to megaloblastic anemia, likely due to concomitant iron deficiency anemia. Although retrospective, this might suggest low utility for routine serum folic acid testing in healthy children in developed countries, except in cases of celiac disease or specific medication use such psychostimulants or antipsychotics. • Folic acid deficiency is common among children in developing countries, causing megaloblastic anemia, growth delays, and cognitive impairments. In developed countries, the prevalence is considered low. • Of 20,411 pediatric patients tested for serum folate, in a developed country, only 4.3% had folate deficiency. • Risk factors for deficiency included celiac, antipsychotics, and psychostimulant treatment for ADHD. • Routine folate testing in developed countries may have limited utility; Targeted screening is recommended.","Michal Vinker-Shuster, Amber Nakar-Weinstein, Chani Topf-Olivestone, Dan Raved, Avivit Golan-Cohen, Eugene Merzon, Ilan Green","European journal of pediatrics","2024Sep27",NA

We analyzed data from 10,325 normotensive participants using cumulative average dietary consumption from repeated food frequency questionnaires during the follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated with a modified Poisson regression model and a robust error estimator to evaluate the association between hypertension risk and total consumption of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, as well as their 17 subgroups. During an average follow-up of 5.20 years, 2159 cases of hypertension were recorded. Total consumption of FVL, FV, fruits, vegetables, and legumes showed overall inverse trends with hypertension risk. Considering multiplicity, fruit consumption was inversely associated with hypertension risk in both men (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52-0.79) and women (IRR 0.76; 95% CI 0.64-0.91). Vegetables were inversely associated with hypertension in women (IRR 0.67; 95% CI 0.53-0.86). Most subgroups showed inverse associations, especially in men with overweight/obesity. However, frequent pickled green leafy vegetable consumption was positively associated with hypertension risk in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal women (Pinteraction = 0.0004). Consumption of FVL, including their subgroups, generally shows inverse associations with hypertension risk. However, caution is advised for recommending pickled vegetables, particularly for postmenopausal women, due to the potential adverse effects of sodium. The benefits of these foods in preventing hypertension are especially pronounced in men with overweight/obesity.","Ji-Sook Kong, Yu-Mi Kim, Min-Ho Shin, Sang Baek Koh, Hyeon Chang Kim, Jinho Shin, Mi Kyung Kim","European journal of nutrition","2024Sep26",NA

Data regarding IH after major pancreatic surgery are limited. We aim to evaluate the long-term risk of IH following major pancreatic resection. A dual-approach study: a large multi-institutional research network (RN) was investigated for IH incidence and risk factors in propensity-score matched survivors after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatectomy (DP), was complemented by a patient-reported questionnaire. RN analysis identified 22,113 patients that underwent pancreatic surgery. 11.0% of PD patients and 8.6% of DP patients developed IH (P < 0.0001). IH rates were higher with open surgery compared with minimally invasive approaches in PD (OR = 1.56, P = 0.03) and DP (OR = 1.94, P = 0.003). BMI>35 was found to correlate with increased IH rates for PD and DP (OR = 1.87, and OR = 1.86, respectively, P < 0.0001 each), as did postoperative intraabdominal infections (P < 0.0001). Patient-based survey of 104 patients, revealed that 16 patients (15%) reported post-operative IH during the follow-up period.

"39327094","Sedentarism and Chronic Health Problems.","Increased mechanization and technological advances have simplified our lives on the one hand and increased sedentary behaviors on the other hand, paving the way for emerging global health concerns, i.e., sedentarism, which could be the leading cause of all major chronic health problems worldwide. Sedentarism is a habitual behavior of choosing and indulging in low-energy expenditure activities (≤1.5 metabolic equivalents), such as chairtype (sitting, studying, traveling) or screen-type activities (TV, computers, mobile). With technological advancements, there is a significant transition in the lifestyles of people from being active (walking) to being more deskbound (sitting). Prolonged sitting can have unintended consequences for health with sitting time >7 h/d, leading to a 5% increase in all-cause mortality with each additional hour spent sitting (i.e., +7 h/d), while considering physical activity levels. This review will highlight how sedentarism is emerging as a major risk factor for the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases, especially among young adults and adults. Chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cancer, are the leading causes of death worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need for collective action to mitigate the burgeoning public health crisis posed by sedentarism in the 21st century. This paper intends to set in motion a call for all policymakers and public health professionals placed nationally or internationally to reach a consensus on ending sedentarism and provide viable resolutions for effective management of excessive sedentary behaviors and healthy adoption and maintenance of active lifestyles among individuals of all age groups.","Jyoti Goyal, Gurseen Rakhra","Korean journal of family medicine","2024Sep",NA
"39327067","Applying machine learning approaches for predicting obesity risk using US health administrative claims database.","Body mass index (BMI) is inadequately recorded in US administrative claims databases. We aimed to validate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of BMI-related diagnosis codes using an electronic medical records (EMR) claims-linked database. Additionally, we applied machine learning (ML) to identify features in US claims databases to predict obesity status. This observational, retrospective analysis included 692 119 people ≥18 years of age, with ≥1 BMI reading in MarketScan Explorys Claims-EMR data (January 2013-December 2019). Claims-based obesity status was compared with EMR-based BMI (gold standard) to assess BMI-related diagnosis code sensitivity and PPV. Logistic regression (LR), penalized LR with L1 penalty (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest, with features drawn from insurance claims, were trained to predict obesity status (BMI≥30 kg/m2) from EMR as the gold standard. Model performance was compared using several metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The best-performing model was applied to assess feature importance. Obesity risk scores were computed from the best model generated from the claims database and compared against the BMI recorded in the EMR. The PPV of diagnosis codes from claims alone remained high over the study period (85.4-89.2%); sensitivity was low (16.8-44.8%). XGBoost performed the best at predicting obesity with the highest area under the curve (AUC; 79.4%) and the lowest Brier score. The number of obesity diagnoses and obesity diagnoses from inpatient settings were the most important predictors of obesity. XGBoost showed an AUC of 74.1% when trained without an obesity diagnosis. Obesity prevalence is under-reported in claims databases. ML models, with or without explicit obesity, show promise in improving obesity prediction accuracy compared with obesity codes alone. Improved obesity status prediction may assist practitioners and payors to estimate the burden of obesity and investigate the potential unmet needs of current treatments.","Casey Choong, Alan Brnabic, Chanadda Chinthammit, Meena Ravuri, Kendra Terrell, Hong Kan","BMJ open diabetes research & care","2024Sep26","Humans; Machine Learning; Obesity; Male; Female; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Adult; Databases, Factual; United States; Electronic Health Records; Aged; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Prognosis; Administrative Claims, Healthcare; Risk Assessment; Adolescent; ROC Curve"
"39326862","Dietary Calcium-to-Phosphorous Ratio, Metabolic Risk Factors and Lipid Accumulation Product, Skeletal Muscle Mass, and Visceral Fat Area Among Healthy Young Individuals.","Numerous studies have revealed the role of low dietary calcium-to-phosphorous ratio and low bone health. However, its possible role in visceral adiposity, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and metabolic parameters has not been investigated before. Therefore, the aim of the current cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relation between dietary calcium-to-phosphorous ratio, metabolic risk factors, SMM, and visceral fat area (VFA) among physically active young individuals. In the current study, the sample was composed of 391 healthy young individuals (e.g., 205 men and 186 women), aged between 20 and 35 years old, who were engaged in moderate physical activity for at least 4 hr per week and were recruited thorough cluster sampling from seven sport clubs. Anthropometric measurements were performed, and VFA and SMM index (SMI) were calculated. Biochemical assays were also performed by standard kits. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, analysis of co-variance, and multinomial logistic regression analysis using SPSS software. Those in the fourth quartile of dietary calcium-to-phosphorous ratio were more likely to have lower VFA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.97, 0.99]; p = .023) and a nonsignificantly higher SMI (OR = 1.15; 95% CI [0.99, 1.34]; p = .058) after adjustment for the effects of confounders (e.g., age, gender, body mass index, physical activity level, dietary energy intake). Also, being in the third quartile of dietary calcium-to-phosphorous ratio made the subjects more susceptible to have lower insulin concentration (OR = 0.99; 95% CI [0.88, 0.93]; p = .026) in the adjusted model. The findings of the current study revealed that a higher dietary calcium-to-phosphorous ratio in the habitual diet was negatively associated with visceral adiposity and insulin concentrations and higher SMM among physically active young individuals. Further interventional studies are required to confer causality that was not inferable in the current study because of cross-sectional design.","Xuanshang Jin, Xiangchuan Jin, Wen Guan, Maolin Tang","International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism","2024Sep26",NA

However, the diagnostic criteria for frailty are inconsistent because of complex pathological processes and diverse clinical manifestations. To determine the effective biomarker and recognize frail status early, we investigated the correlation of mitochondrial morphology and function of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with frailty status in older adults. This Cross-sectional study followed 393 participants (aged 25-100 years, female 31.04 %) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The frailty status of subjects was assessed by the physical frailty phenotype (PFP) scale. We analyzed mitochondria functions including mitochondria copy number (mtDNAcn), the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial dynamics-related genes mitofusin 1(MFN1), mitofusin 2(MFN2), optic atrophy protein-1(OPA1), fission protein-1(FIS1) and dynamin-related protein 1(DRP1), mitochondrial oxidative respiration and reactive oxygen species(ROS) levels in PBMCs. Mitochondria morphology, size, and number were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After adjustment for sex and BMI, mtDNAcn, the mRNA expression of FIS1, mitochondrial respiratory function (proton leak, maximum oxygen consumption, and respiratory reserve) and ROS level were significantly correlated with age (P = 0.031, 0.030, 0.042, 0.003, 0.002, 0.022, respectively). After correcting for age, sex, and BMI, mtDNAcn and the mRNA expression of OPA1 were correlated with 4 m gait speed respectively (P = 0.003, 0.028, respectively). Compared with non-frail people, mtDNAcn, the mRNA expression of MFN1, mitochondrial basal respiration, proton leak, maximum oxygen consumption, ATP production and space capacity were significantly decreased in frail older adults (P = 0.013, 0.036, 0.026, 0.024, 0.012, 0.032, 0.020, respectively). ROS levels were significantly increased in the frail group (P = 0.016).

(P. japonica), a member of the Polygala genus in the Polygalaceae family, has been historically utilized in traditional folk medicine as an expectorant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-depressant agent. This paper systematically reviews the latest research in botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, aiming to provide a scientific foundation for the future development and application of P. japonica and to explore its potential value comprehensively. Approximately 86 compounds have been isolated from P. japonica, with triterpenoid saponins being the most prevalent and bioactive components. Extensive pharmacological activities of P. japonica extracts or compounds have been confirmed in vivo and in vitro, including anti-inflammatory, anti-depressant, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, anti-apoptotic, and skin-protective effects. Additionally, P. japonica has demonstrated significant curative effects and relatively clear pharmacological mechanisms in treating inflammatory and nervous system diseases. Specific components of its primary triterpenoid saponins are rapidly absorbed in the body. This review advocates for deeper scientific research on P. japonica, noting that most current research remains in its early stages and many reported biological activities require further clinical validation. Despite this, the traditional medical use of P. japonica across various cultures attests to its broad application value. Presently, the pharmacological activities of P. japonica extracts and compounds provide a scientific basis for its traditional uses. Future research must ensure the safety and effectiveness of P. japonica through in-depth pharmacokinetic studies, and the establishment of a refined and standardized quality evaluation system is essential for its clinical development and application.","Hai-Peng Tang, En-Lin Zhu, Qian-Xiang Bai, Shuang Wang, Zhi-Bin Wang, Meng Wang, Hai-Xue Kuang","Fitoterapia","2024Sep24",NA
"39326730","Elective Root Replacement Increases the Risk of Type B Dissection in Patients with Marfan Syndrome.","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder with increased risk of aortic dissection. Currently, type A aortic dissection risk is mitigated by aortic root replacement with Dacron. It is unclear if root replacement increases the risk of distal aortic disease given the non-compliant nature of Dacron. All adult patients with a diagnosis of MFS at a single academic center, excluding those with history of dissection or concomitant arch repair, were studied (n=322). Student's t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used for continuous variables; Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Propensity matching used age, sex, hypertension, race, BMI, family history of MFS, and genetic mutational class. Differences in freedom from type B aortic dissection (TBAD) were determined using the log-rank test. 124 patients underwent root replacement (RR) compared to 198 patients with no prior aortic surgery (NRR). Median follow-up time was 9.90 years. Male sex, weight, and hypertension prevalence was higher in the RR group (p<0.05). Distribution of fibrillin-1 mutations was homogenous (p>0.9). TBAD frequency in the RR group was higher (21% (n=20) vs 4.2% (n=4), p<0.001). Aortic-related mortality was higher in the RR group (11% (n=14) vs. 3.5% (n=7), p<0.01). Distal aortic intervention frequency was higher in the RR group (p=0.009). Marfan syndrome patients who undergo elective aortic root replacement appear to have a higher incidence of subsequent type B aortic dissection, independent of other risk factors.

To investigate folate and cobalamin status and determinants throughout pregnancy, in the absence of mandatory fortification with folic acid (FA). In a cohort study of 831 women recruited at <12 gestational weeks (GW), plasma folate, total homocysteine (tHcy), cobalamin, holotranscobalamin (holoTC), methylmalonic acid (MMA), red blood cell folate (RBCF) concentrations and the combined cobalamin status indicator (cB12) were determined at ≤12, 15, 24-27, 34 GW, labor and in the cord. Single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting folate and cobalamin status were determined. FA, cobalamin, micronutrient supplement use and dietary folate and cobalamin intake (food frequency questionnaire) were recorded. Folate and cobalamin status predictors were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis. Only 36.1% of the participants took FA preconceptionally and 47.4% and 7.3% had suboptimal RBCF (<906 nmol/L) and plasma cobalamin status (≤221 pmol/L), respectively, at ≤12 GW. RBCF status was principally determined by planned pregnancy, FA supplementation, plasma cobalamin and methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) 677C>T genotype. Cobalamin supplement use was positively associated, while smoking and BMI were inversely associated with plasma cobalamin and holoTC. None of these were associated with plasma MMA. Only participants with the MTHFR 677TT genotype exceeding FA supplement recommendations improved their folate status (interaction term: B (95% CI):0.015 (0.01, 0.29), p: 0.032).

A retrospective study was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2020. Patients 40 and older who received a meniscectomy or a meniscal repair with a minimum 1 year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was ipsilateral knee reoperation during the study period. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to determine differences in reoperation rates for meniscal repair and meniscectomy over time. Multivariable cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with earlier time-to-reoperation. A total of 3026 patients (2,367 meniscectomy, 659 meniscal repair) were included. Mean follow-up was 14.5 ± 0.29 years (range: 1.0-14.91 years). There were no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics of follow-up between the two groups. The survival curves of the two procedures significantly differed (P=0.02), and the overall reoperation rate was higher after meniscal repair than meniscectomy (13.5% vs. 10.1%, P=0.01). However, the incidence of subsequent ipsilateral meniscectomy, meniscal repair, and knee arthroplasty procedures did not significantly differ. Multivariable cox regression analysis identified meniscal repair, obesity, concomitant ACL reconstruction, and increasing age as being significant risks for earlier reoperation, and male sex was protective. In a population of patients aged ≥40 with surgically treated meniscal tears and 14.5-year average follow-up, meniscal repair was associated with higher overall reoperation with shorter survival times compared to meniscectomy. However, the indications for the two procedures likely differed. Additionally, obesity, older age, female sex, and concomitant ACLR were risk factors for earlier reoperation.","Arjun N Choudhary, Richard Puzzitiello, Matthew Salzler, David Freccero","Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association","2024Sep24",NA

Six focus group discussions were conducted with an inductive approach among obese YAs (18-30 years) recruited through snowball and purposive sampling. The principle of maximum diversity was used to build a pool of varied and extensive information regarding obesity in YAs. The discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim using NVivo 1.0 by QSR International to generate codes, subthemes, and themes from the discussions. Among the thirty recruited YAs (mean age 24.7 ± 2.84 years), nearly half were from a high-income group (56.6 %) and had postgraduate education (53.3 %). Key themes included the need for increased awareness about obesity risk factors and consequences across different societal levels. Physical appearance was the primary motivator for weight loss, followed by physical endurance and social support. Major barriers included lack of energy, time, motivation, lifestyle changes, easy access to unhealthy foods, work commitments, and workplace culture. A holistic approach involving dietary changes, physical activity, and educational and policy reforms was suggested as potential solutions. The challenges faced by YAs in developing countries regarding different aspects of the development and management of obesity are unique and different from the other population groups.

Forty-two food groups were analyzed from dietary information collected with food frequency questionnaires, using principal component analysis and cluster analysis and then information from both statistical methods was compared. Prevalences were calculated foreach cluster group, based on the number and types of metabolic syndrome criteria they met. Following principal component analysis, two dietary patterns labeled ""healthy"" and ""unhealthy"" were identified in both men and women, due to the presence of foods that are considered more or less healthy. These same dietary patterns were found in cluster analysis plus an ""intermediate"" cluster consisting of both healthy and unhealthy foods. The presence of metabolic syndrome is related to the ""healthy"" dietary pattern in women and to the ""unhealthy"" dietary pattern in men. Comparison of the two statistical approaches showed a high level of correlation between them (weighted Kappa = 0.703 in women and weighted Kappa = 0.691 in men).

In the case of Spanish children and adolescents, there seems to be a stabilization in the rates of overweight and obesity, with the exception of the group of girls aged 10-15 years, where a gradual increase has been observed in the last 10 years.","Ana María Cebrián Cuenca, Javier Escalada","Atencion primaria","2024Sep25",NA
"39326064","Prediction of intrapartum caesarean section in vaginal breech birth: development of models for nulliparous and multiparous women.","To develop prediction models for intrapartum caesarean section in vaginal breech birth. This single-center cohort-study included 262 nulliparous and 230 multiparous women attempting vaginal breech birth. For both groups, we developed and (internally) validated three models for the prediction of intrapartum cesarean section. The prediction model for nulliparous women (AUC: 0.67) included epidural analgesia (aOR 2.14; p=0.01), maternal height (aOR 0.64 per 10 cm; p=0.08), birthweight ≥3.8 kg (aOR 2.45; p=0.03) and an interaction term describing the effect of OC if birthweight is ≥3.8 kg (aOR 0.24; p=0.04). An alternative model for nulliparous women which, instead of birthweight, included fetal abdominal circumference with a cut-off at 34 cm (aOR 1.93; p=0.04), showed similar performance (AUC: 0.68). The prediction model for multiparous women (AUC: 0.77) included prelabor rupture of membranes (aOR 0.31; p=0.03), epidural analgesia (aOR 2.42; p=0.07), maternal BMI (aOR 2.92 per 10 kg/m2; p=0.01) and maternal age (aOR 3.17 per decade; p=0.06). Our prediction models show the most relevant risk factors associated with intrapartum cesarean section in vaginal breech birth for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Importantly, this study clarifies the role of the OC by showing that this parameter is only associated with intrapartum cesarean section if birthweight is above 3.8 kg (or abdominal circumference is above 34 cm). Conversely, knowing the OC when the birthweight is less than 3.8 kg (or abdominal circumference is less than 34 cm) did not improve prediction of this surgical outcome.","Massimiliano Lia, Elisabeth Költzsch, Mireille Martin, Noura Kabbani, Holger Stepan","Journal of perinatal medicine","2024Sep30",NA
"39326046","Changes in 10-Year Predicted Cardiovascular Disease Risk for a Multiethnic Semirural Population in South East Asia: Prospective Study.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors tend to cluster and interact multiplicatively and have been incorporated into risk equations such as the Framingham risk score, which can reasonably predict CVD over short- and long-term periods. Beyond risk factor levels at a single time point, recent evidence demonstrated that risk trajectories are differentially related to CVD risk. However, factors associated with suboptimal control or unstable CVD risk trajectories are not yet established. This study aims to examine factors associated with CVD risk trajectories in a semirural, multiethnic community-dwelling population. Data on demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, mental health, and cardiovascular factors were measured at baseline (2013) and during follow-up (2018) of the South East Asia Community Observatory cohort. The 10-year CVD risk change transition was computed. The trajectory patterns identified were improved; remained unchanged in low, moderate, or high CVD risk clusters; and worsened CVD risk trajectories. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between risk factors and changes in Framingham risk score and predicted CVD risk trajectory patterns with adjustments for concurrent risk factors. Of the 6599 multiethnic community-dwelling individuals (n=3954, 59.92% female participants and n=2645, 40.08% male participants; mean age 55.3, SD 10.6 years), CVD risk increased over time in 33.37% (n=2202) of the sample population, while 24.38% (n=1609 remained in the high-risk trajectory pattern, which was reflected by the increased prevalence of all major CVD risk factors over the 5-year follow-up. Meanwhile, sex-specific prevalence data indicate that 21.44% (n=567) of male and 41.35% (n=1635) of female participants experienced an increase in CVD risk. However, a stark sex difference was observed in those remaining in the high CVD risk cluster, with 45.1% (n=1193) male participants and 10.52% (n=416) female participants. Regarding specific CVD risk factors, male participants exhibited a higher percentage increase in the prevalence of hypertension, antihypertensive medication use, smoking, and obesity, while female participants showed a higher prevalence of diabetes. Further regression analyses identified that Malay compared to Chinese (P<.001) and Indian (P=.04) ethnicity, nonmarried status (P<.001), full-time employment (P<.001), and depressive symptoms (P=.04) were all significantly associated with increased CVD risk scores. In addition, lower educational levels and frequently having meals from outside were significantly associated to higher odds of both worsening and remaining in high CVD risk trajectories. Sociodemographics and mental health were found to be differently associated with CVD risk trajectories, warranting future research to disentangle the role of psychosocial disparities in CVD. Our findings carry public health implications, suggesting that the rise in major risk factors along with psychosocial disparities could potentially elevate CVD risk among individuals in underserved settings. More prevention efforts that continuously monitor CVD risk and consider changes in risk factors among vulnerable populations should be emphasized.","Hamimatunnisa Johar, Chiew Way Ang, Roshidi Ismail, Zaid Kassim, Tin Tin Su","JMIR public health and surveillance","2024Sep26","Humans; Male; Female; Cardiovascular Diseases; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Adult; Risk Factors; Asia, Southeastern; Aged; Ethnicity; Risk Assessment; Heart Disease Risk Factors"
"39325990","Preoperative physiotherapy for improving the reserve capacity in a patient with esophageal cancer and frailty: A case report.","Frailty is significantly correlated with a higher incidence of medical complications during hospitalization after esophagectomy. As frailty is thought to be a reversible condition, improving the reserve capacity through preoperative physical therapy is expected to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Herein, we report our experience with preoperative physical therapy in a patient with esophageal cancer who was considered to have inadequate fitness for surgery owing to poor physical performance. A 72-year-old man (height: 169.5 cm, weight: 54.7 kg, body mass index: 18.9 kg/m2) with esophagogastric junction tumors (cStage IIIA) was hospitalized and scheduled to undergo surgery based on preoperative screening. He was categorized as frail according to the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria and the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form indicated severe malnutrition. We focused on physical therapy to improve exercise tolerance and prevent PPCs and devised a short-term intensive physical therapy program comprising minimal exercises that the patient could perform efficiently. The program consisted of only inspiratory muscle training and aerobic exercises. His maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and 6-min walking distance improved by 30 cm H2O and 145 m, respectively, on the day before surgery compared with those on day 8. The percentage predicted value of the MIP improved from 56.6% at the start of physical therapy to 102.9% on the day before surgery. On day 43, the patient underwent subtotal esophagectomy and was able to ambulate on postoperative day 5 without respiratory complications. We conducted a short-term, intensive, and minimal preoperative physical therapy program for a patient with esophageal cancer who had physical frailty. Preoperative physical therapy to increase the reserve capacity may result in a favorable postoperative course even in patients with physical frailty.","Yusuke Takahashi, Kazuki Okura, Ririko Sakamoto, Kakeru Hasegawa, Yushi Nagaki, Akiyuki Wakita, Yusuke Sato","Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy","2024Oct","Humans; Aged; Male; Esophageal Neoplasms; Frailty; Preoperative Care; Physical Therapy Modalities; Esophagectomy; Postoperative Complications; Exercise Tolerance"
"39325955","Risk Factors for Neonatal Clavicular Fractures: A Population-Based Case-Control Study.","Neonatal clavicular fractures represent the most common fracture during delivery. We aimed to define risk factors associated with these fractures in a large population-based database. Data were extracted from Clalit Health Services' electronic health records from 2000 to 2020. Newborns with clavicular fractures were compared with a healthy control group. The following parameters were compared-for the newborns: sex, birth weight, birth height, and head circumference; for the delivery process: assisted delivery, cesarean section, use of epidural, birth week, and number of fetuses; and for the mother: age at delivery, socioeconomic status, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). We found a rate of 0.28% for neonatal clavicular fractures (5015 clavicular fractures/1 755 660 deliveries). Male gender and heavier birth weight were found to be significantly associated with clavicular fractures (P < .001). Increased risk was also associated with lower socioeconomic status, baseline weight, and maternal BMI (P < .001 for all). Assisted delivery increased the risk of clavicular fracture (OR = 2.274; 95% CI, 1.661-3.115; P < .0001), while cesarean section and use of epidural were found to be protective (OR = 0.149; 95% CI, 0.086-0.26; P < .0001; and OR = 0.687; 95% CI, 0.0531-0.89; P < .004, respectively).

"39325863","Sagittal Fragment Rotation and Ogden Type-I Classification Are Hallmarks of Combined Tibial Tubercle Fracture and Patellar Tendon Injury.","Tibial tubercle fractures (TTFs) are uncommon injuries, comprising <3% of all proximal tibial fractures. These fractures occasionally occur in conjunction with a patellar tendon injury (PTI). We aimed to identify risk factors associated with combined TTF and PTI. A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to a single, tertiary children's hospital with TTF between 2012 and 2023. Demographic data, operative details, radiographs, and injury patterns were analyzed. Radiographs were assessed for the epiphyseal union stage (EUS), Ogden classification, and fracture patterns. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of body mass index, comminution, fracture fragment rotation, EUS, bilateral injury, and Ogden classification on injury type. We identified 262 fractures in 252 patients (mean age, 13.9 ± 1.31 years). Of the patients, 6% were female and 48% were Black. Of the 262 fractures, 228 (87%) were isolated TTFs and 34 (13%) were TTFs with PTI. Multivariable analysis demonstrated fragment rotation on lateral radiographs (p < 0.0001) and Ogden Type-I classification (p < 0.0001) to be the most predictive risk factors for a combined injury. Rotation was associated with a substantial increase in the odds of a combined injury, with an odds ratio of 22.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to 80.1). Ogden Type-I fracture was another significant risk factor, with an odds ratio of 10.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 30.4). The Ogden classification and fragment rotation are the most useful features for distinguishing between isolated TTF and combined TTF with PTI. This is the first study to identify risk factors for TTF combined with PTI. Surgeons may use this information to aid in preoperative planning. Diagnostic Level III.

"39325845","Infection patterns of scabies and tinea between inland and resettled indigenous Negrito communities in Peninsular Malaysia.","Skin infections cause significant health burden and affect underserved communities such as the indigenous Negrito communities disproportionately. There is only one study that has addressed skin infections among the Negrito communities, which is the smallest and most isolated indigenous tribe in Peninsular Malaysia, with approximately 6,500 individuals remaining in northern and central Peninsular Malaysia. This study, which aims to update the infection patterns of scabies and tinea among the Negrito communities, recruited 361 participants from eight villages representing all six Negrito subtribes. The results revealed an overall skin infection prevalence of 35.6%, with scabies (11.7%), tinea versicolor (11.3%), and tinea imbricata (7.5%) as major infections, with no co-infection. Notably, infection rates were significantly higher in resettled villages (55.2%) compared to inland villages (24.8%). Scabies and tinea versicolor were more prevalent in resettled villages (21.2% and 23.6%, respectively) than inland villages (6.4% and 4.7%, respectively), while tinea imbricata was more common in inland villages (9.4% vs 3.9%). Furthermore, there exist predisposition of scabies among Kensiu. High prevalence of tinea imbricata was observed among the inland Bateq while prevalence of tinea versicolor was high among the resettled Bateq. Risk analysis revealed specific associations: scabies with Kensiu subtribe (P = 0.002), high income (P = 0.001) and underweight individuals (P = 0.009); tinea versicolor with Bateq subtribe (P = 0.003), resettled villagers (P < 0.001), males (p = 0.040), and overweight/obese individuals (P = 0.015); and tinea imbricata with Bateq (P = 0.011) and smokers (P = 0.004). These findings highlight a complex interplay between environment and lifestyle in skin infection prevalence. Addressing these infections requires targeted interventions, including regular medical care in inland villages and socio-economic support for resettled communities, considering the distinct predispositions in different village types.","Yi Xian Er, Leslie Thian Lung Than, Azdayanti Muslim, Nan Jiun Yap, Mian Zi Tee, Nurmanisha Abdull-Majid, Soo Ching Lee, Shezryna Shahrizal, Yvonne Ai Lian Lim","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","2024Sep26",NA
"39325793","Is weight-adjusted waist index more strongly associated with diabetes than body mass index and waist circumference?: Results from the database large community sample study.","The uncertainty regarding the correlation between the weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) and diabetes within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) necessitates further exploration. As indicators of obesity, the differences in the intensity of association between WWI, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) with diabetes are worth exploring. This investigation is undertaken to elucidate the association between WWI and diabetes in the NHANES dataset and to compare the extent to which BMI, WC, and WWI were closely associated with diabetes. Then, choose an obesity index that is more strongly associated with diabetes. A comprehensive cross-sectional stratified survey of 7,973 participants from the 2017-2020 NHANES was conducted. WWI is an anthropometric measure based on WC and weight. The formula is WWI (cm/√kg) = WC/√weight. The association between WWI and diabetes was investigated using weighted multiple logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, stratified analysis, and interaction testing. The participants' average age was 50.84±17.34 years, and 50.68% of them were female. The detection rate of diabetes was 15.11%. This positive association was particularly notable among non-diabetic patients. For each unit increase in BMI and WC as continuous variables, the likelihood of developing diabetes in the fully adjusted model increased by 5% (OR = 1.05; 95%CI, 1.03-1.07) and 3% (OR = 1.03; 95%CI, 1.02-1.04), respectively, but for each one-unit increase in WWI, the likelihood of developing diabetes increased by 111% (OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.68-2.65). Tests of interactions revealed that in various subgroups, the association between diabetes and WWI remained steady. We analyzed 2017-2020 NHANES data to explore the link between WWI and diabetes, finding a consistent positive correlation. The correlation between WWI and diabetes was stronger than that between WC and BMI. WWI seems to offer better potential aid in disease prevention and diagnosis.","Jiabei Wu, Jinli Guo","PloS one","2024","Humans; Female; Waist Circumference; Male; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutrition Surveys; Diabetes Mellitus; Aged; Body Weight; Obesity"

"39325753","Predicting age at onset of childhood obesity using regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbour-A case study in Saudi Arabia.","Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity are one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. A range of genetic, family, and environmental factors, and health behaviors are associated with childhood obesity. Developing models to predict childhood obesity requires careful examination of how these factors contribute to the emergence of childhood obesity. This paper has employed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) models to predict the age at the onset of childhood obesity in Saudi Arabia (S.A.) and to identify the significant factors associated with it. De-identified data from Arar and Riyadh regions of S.A. were used to develop the prediction models and to compare their performance using multi-prediction accuracy measures. The average age at the onset of obesity is 10.8 years with no significant difference between boys and girls. The most common age group for onset is (5-15) years. RF model with the R2 = 0.98, the root mean square error = 0.44, and mean absolute error = 0.28 outperformed other models followed by MLR, DT, and KNN. The age at the onset of obesity was linked to several demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors including height and weight, parents' education level and income, consanguineous marriage, family history, autism, gestational age, nutrition in the first 6 months, birth weight, sleep hours, and lack of physical activities. The results can assist in reducing the childhood obesity epidemic in Saudi Arabia by identifying and managing high-risk individuals and providing better preventive care. Furthermore, the study findings can assist in predicting and preventing childhood obesity in other populations.","Salem Hamoud Alanazi, Mali Abdollahian, Laleh Tafakori, Kheriah Ahmed Almulaihan, Salman Mutarid ALruwili, Omar Falleh ALenazi","PloS one","2024","Humans; Saudi Arabia; Pediatric Obesity; Child; Male; Female; Decision Trees; Adolescent; Child, Preschool; Age of Onset; Risk Factors; Random Forest"
"39325528","Controlled and Real-Life Investigation of Optical Tracking Sensors in Smart Glasses for Monitoring Eating Behavior Using Deep Learning: Cross-Sectional Study.","The increasing prevalence of obesity necessitates innovative approaches to better understand this health crisis, particularly given its strong connection to chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions. Monitoring dietary behavior is crucial for designing effective interventions that help decrease obesity prevalence and promote healthy lifestyles. However, traditional dietary tracking methods are limited by participant burden and recall bias. Exploring microlevel eating activities, such as meal duration and chewing frequency, in addition to eating episodes, is crucial due to their substantial relation to obesity and disease risk. The primary objective of the study was to develop an accurate and noninvasive system for automatically monitoring eating and chewing activities using sensor-equipped smart glasses. The system distinguishes chewing from other facial activities, such as speaking and teeth clenching. The secondary objective was to evaluate the system's performance on unseen test users using a combination of laboratory-controlled and real-life user studies. Unlike state-of-the-art studies that focus on detecting full eating episodes, our approach provides a more granular analysis by specifically detecting chewing segments within each eating episode. The study uses OCO optical sensors embedded in smart glasses to monitor facial muscle activations related to eating and chewing activities. The sensors measure relative movements on the skin's surface in 2 dimensions (X and Y). Data from these sensors are analyzed using deep learning (DL) to distinguish chewing from other facial activities. To address the temporal dependence between chewing events in real life, we integrate a hidden Markov model as an additional component that analyzes the output from the DL model. Statistical tests of mean sensor activations revealed statistically significant differences across all 6 comparison pairs (P<.001) involving 2 sensors (cheeks and temple) and 3 facial activities (eating, clenching, and speaking). These results demonstrate the sensitivity of the sensor data. Furthermore, the convolutional long short-term memory model, which is a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks, emerged as the best-performing DL model for chewing detection. In controlled laboratory settings, the model achieved an F1-score of 0.91, demonstrating robust performance. In real-life scenarios, the system demonstrated high precision (0.95) and recall (0.82) for detecting eating segments. The chewing rates and the number of chews evaluated in the real-life study showed consistency with expected real-life eating behaviors. The study represents a substantial advancement in dietary monitoring and health technology. By providing a reliable and noninvasive method for tracking eating behavior, it has the potential to revolutionize how dietary data are collected and used. This could lead to more effective health interventions and a better understanding of the factors influencing eating habits and their health implications.","Simon Stankoski, Ivana Kiprijanovska, Martin Gjoreski, Filip Panchevski, Borjan Sazdov, Bojan Sofronievski, Andrew Cleal, Mohsen Fatoorechi, Charles Nduka, Hristijan Gjoreski","JMIR mHealth and uHealth","2024Sep26","Humans; Deep Learning; Feeding Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Male; Adult; Smart Glasses; Monitoring, Physiologic; Mastication"

This review summarizes the comprehensive management of obesity with a focus on the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of anti-obesity medications. Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease with significant health risks, requiring a multifaceted approach to treatment. While most approved weight loss medications have modest effects, newer medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have shown greater than 15% reduction in baseline weight. Optimal selection of therapy requires taking into consideration patient factors, such as comorbidities and goals, and medication-related factors, including weight loss efficacy, contraindications, and improvements in cardiovascular risk. As the availability of anti-obesity medications increases, multidisciplinary care teams will play an important role in selecting optimal strategies for long-term health benefits in individuals with obesity. The expanding array of anti-obesity medications provides valuable treatment options alongside lifestyle interventions and surgical approaches for managing obesity and reducing weight-related health risks. As this therapeutic area continues to grow, selecting optimal agents and educating patients on administration, monitoring, and potential adverse effects will be critical for improving overall outcomes.","Lourdes Cross","American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists","2024Sep26",NA

A retrospective review at a single quaternary referral center hospital of adult patients who underwent DLI-R over a 5-year period and abdominal computerized tomography (CT) imaging performed within 1-year for any indication postoperatively was conducted. All CTs scans were independently reviewed by staff surgeons to determine the presence of a fascial defect at the DLI-R site. 2,196 patients underwent DLI-R; of these, 569 (25.9%) underwent CT imaging for any indication. Mean patient age, 54.8 (± 14.9), BMI 27.6 kg/m2. 87 (15%) patients had a parastomal hernia at time of DLI-R. After median follow-up of 10 months, 203 patients (35.7%) had IH at the DLI-R site. Age (p = 0.14), sex (p = 0.39), race (p = 0.75), and smoking status (p = 0.82) weren't associated with IH after DLI-R. Comorbidities weren't significantly associated with IH following DLI-R. In univariate analysis, increased BMI (p < 0.001), presence of a parastomal hernia (p = 0.008), and suture type (p = 0.01) were associated with IH development. On multivariate analysis, BMI remained significant, and polyglyconate compared to polydioxanone suture were associated with higher rates of IH (p < 0.001). We observed that the rate of incisional hernias within 1-year of diverting ileostomy reversal was indeed common at 36%. Granted, a high percentage of the population was excluded due to heterogeneity in radiographic evaluation that could be mitigated in future prospective studies.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to explore the role of four cultural variables (acculturation, acculturative stress, ethnic identity, and cultural values) that may help to explain ethnic disparities in correlates of obesity (diet, physical activity, and body image) among Mexican and Puerto Rican women. This paper describes the study design, measures, and initial analyses of participant characteristics, as well as implications for the development of an obesity intervention. A total of 552 participants contacted the study staff, with 368 completing the oral script and initial eligibility interview.

"39325195","[Endoprosthetic treatment of femoral neck fractures in Germany : Cumulative analysis of EPRD registry data from 2013 to 2020].","The German Arthroplasty Registry (EPRD) recorded nearly 52,000 femoral neck fractures treated with arthroplasty by 2020. This study aimed to identify survival rates and risk factors for hip prosthesis failure. The study included all patients with arthroplasty after hip fractures documented in the EPRD. Data were analyzed with focus on failure rate regarding implant, implantation technique, age, BMI, and comorbidities. For more complex analysis of dependencies, the machine learning algorithm (MLA) XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) was used. The study included 51,938 patients. The failure rate was 3.7% for HEs and 5.6% for THA. The failure rate increased in male patients (p < 0.0001), those with higher BMI, young patients with a high Elixhauser Comorbidity Score (ECS) and a cementless technique. The timepoint of surgery, i.e. ,working day vs. weekend or holiday had no influence on the outcome. The feature importance (FI) generated by MLA demonstrated factors with the highest impact on failure, i.e., survival time (1029), BMI (722), and age (481). For younger patients with comorbidities, a cemented implantation technique should be considered. Failure rates of arthroplasties did not differ on workdays compared to weekends or holidays. MLA are suitable to analyze registry data for complex correlations of factors.","Alexander Gotzler, Claudio Glowalla, Florian Hinterwimmer, Dorien Schneidmüller, Sven Hungerer","Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)","2024Sep26",NA
"39325179","Is outpatient joint arthroplasty safe in a high volume academic centre? A retrospective monocentric study using an institutional pathway.","Hip and knee arthroplasties are daily procedures in orthopaedic departments. Recently, same-day discharge (SDD) became increasingly popular, but doubts remain about its safety and generalization. Our hypothesis is that outpatient arthroplasty, in a high volume centre and with an institutional protocol, is an effective and reliable practice. We realized a monocentric retrospective study of patients undergoing outpatient partial (UKA) or total (TKA) knee or hip arthroplasty (THA) in a high volume academic centre using a well-defined institutional pathway. Epidemiological data and complications occurring in the month following surgery were studied. 498 patients undergoing 501 arthroplasties (219 hips and 282 knees) were examined. The percentage of men and women was 60.28% and 39.72% respectively, mean age was 64.56 ± 9.59 years, mean BMI was 26.87 ± 4.2 and the most represented ASA score was 2. The success rate for same-day discharge was 97.21%. The most frequent causes of failure were urinary retention (28.6%), orthostatic hypotension (28.6%) and insufficiently controlled pain (14.3%). The readmission rate in the month following the operation was 0.8% and the rate of emergency department visits was 1.6%. Finally, the rate of early consultation visits was 7.98%. The comparison between success and failure subgroups in the outpatient setting of our cohort did not highlight statistically significant differences for studied parameters. Outpatient arthroplasty, performed in a center used to managing such operations and with a well-established institutional pre- and post-operative protocol, is a safe practice.","Gérald Delfosse, Guillaume Mesnard, Martin Ecki, Cécile Batailler, Elvire Servien, Sébastien Lustig","International orthopaedics","2024Sep26",NA
"39325165","Do modifiable patient factors increase the risk of postoperative complications after total joint arthroplasty?","Numerous studies demonstrate that modifiable lifestyle risk factors can influence patient outcomes including survivability, quality of life, and postoperative complications following orthopaedic surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of modifiable lifestyle risk factors on postoperative medical and surgical complications following a total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in a large national healthcare system. A retrospective chart review of a large national health system database was performed to identify patients who underwent TJA between 2017 and 2021. TJA included total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and total shoulder arthroplasty. Modifiable lifestyle risk factors were defined as tobacco use, narcotic drug abuse, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Postoperative medical complications and postoperative surgical complications were collected. Logistic regression and odds ratio point estimate analysis were conducted to assess for associations between postoperative complications and modifiable lifestyle risk factors. Of the 16,940 patients identified, the mean age was 71 years, mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m2, and 62% were women. We found that 3.5% had used narcotics, 8.7% were past or current smokers, 24% had diabetes, and 61% had hypertension; in addition, 5.4% experienced postoperative medical complications and 6.4% experienced postoperative surgical complications. Patients who used narcotics were 90% more likely to have postoperative complications (p < 0.0001) and 105% more likely to experience prosthetic complications (p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients with tobacco use were 65% more likely to have postoperative complications (p < 0.0001) and 27% more likely to experience prosthetic complications. Our results demonstrate critical rates of increased postoperative medical and surgical complications after TJA for patients with narcotic abuse, tobacco use, or diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, adopting preoperative interventions and optimization programs informed by our findings on specific modifiable risk factors could aid orthopaedic surgeons in optimizing patient health.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum markers for thrombophilia and rapid thromboelastography (r-TEG) values correlate with increased VTE risk among patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures. Prospective observational study. Two urban academic level 1 trauma centers. Adult patients with isolated pelvis and/or acetabulum fractures (OTA/AO 61 and 62) treated surgically placed on a standardized VTE chemoprophylaxis regimen with enoxaparin over a 5-year period were included. Serum r-TEG, coagulation laboratory values, and markers for heritable thrombophilia were drawn postoperatively and after completion of a 6-week course of enoxaparin. The primary outcome was VTE event (either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) diagnosed using a Duplex ultrasound, chest computed tomography angiogram, or lung ventilation-perfusion ordered based on clinical suspicion of a VTE event. Laboratory markers and values were then compared between patients who went on to have a VTE event and those who did not and patients with and without markers of thrombophilia. One hundred thirty-three adult patients with isolated operative pelvic and/or acetabular fractures were enrolled in this study. The average age of patients at time of injury was 48.3 years (range 18-91). Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study were (n = 90) males. Sixty-three percent of patients (n = 84) completed both clinical and laboratory follow-up. Forty-one percent of patients (n = 54) had 1 or more markers of heritable thrombophilia. Twelve percent (n = 10) of patients who completed follow-up were diagnosed with VTE. Age, sex, and smoking status were not associated with VTE. Patients who developed VTE had a higher body mass index (P = 0.04). Having more than 1 marker of heritable thrombophilia (P = 0.004) and an r-TEG mean amplitude greater than 72 mm postoperatively was positively associated with VTE (P = 0.02). Among patients treated surgically for isolated pelvic and acetabular fractures who received enoxaparin prophylaxis, the presence of more than 1 marker of heritable thrombophilia or r-TEG mean amplitude value greater than 72 mm postoperatively was associated with an increased risk of VTE.

Clinically, interpatient body composition changes are heterogeneous, but the biologic and clinical determinants of body composition toxicity are unknown. Herein, we test the hypothesis that inherited polymorphisms in steroidogenic genes are associated with differential change in body composition after HT. Men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BCR) who received 8 months of LHRH analog (LHRHa) +/- abiraterone acetate (AAP) were eligible if they had: 1) CT imaging of L3 prior to and after treatment, and 2) nucleated cells collected. Cardiometabolic co-morbidities were retrospectively extracted. Body composition was measured using an AI-based segmentation tool. Germline DNA whole exome or genome sequencing was performed. In 162 men treated with 8 months of HT, median skeletal muscle mass (SMMi) loss was 6.6% and subcutaneous adipose gain was 12.3%. Men with type 2 diabetes had higher loss of SMMi after treatment (-11.1% vs. -6.3%, p = 0.003). For the 150 men with germline NGS, SRD5A2 rs523349 genotype was associated with differential loss in skeletal muscle density after HT, (-1.3% vs. -7.1%, p=0.04). In addition, HSD3B1 rs104703 genotype was associated with decreased baseline visceral adipose tissue (63.0 cm2/m2 vs. 77.9, p=0.05). In men with BCR, HT induced notable loss of skeletal muscle and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue. An inherited polymorphism in SRD5A2 and T2DM were associated with differential skeletal muscle toxicity. These findings suggest that inherited polymorphisms may contribute to the body composition toxicity observed with HT.","Neha Venkatesh, Rebecca S Tidwell, Yao Yu, Ana Aparicio, Amado J Zurita, Sumit K Subudhi, Bilal A Siddiqui, Sagar S Mukhida, Justin R Gregg, Paul G Corn, Efstratios Koutroumpakis, Jennifer L McQuade, Daniel E Frigo, Patrick G Pilie, Chad Huff, Christopher J Logothetis, Andrew W Hahn","Endocrine-related cancer","2024Sep01",NA
"39324842","Exposure of Pregnancy to Pregestational Diabetes, Gestational Diabetes, and Antidiabetic Medications With Especial Focus on Major Congenital and Cardiac Malformations in Offspring.","The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing. T2DM is more common in patients with psychiatric disorders and those who take certain psychotropic drugs. T2DM occurs in 2%-7% of women of reproductive age. The prevalence of pregestational diabetes is 0.5%-2.4%, and that of gestational diabetes is 7%-28%, depending on geographical region. About 20%-50% of pregnancies, across the world, are unplanned; this figure is higher, at about 65%, in women with psychiatric disorders. As a result, many women of reproductive age who have diabetes, including women who do not know that they have diabetes, may unintentionally become pregnant, thus unknowingly exposing their pregnancy to diabetes and its treatment. Exposure of pregnancy to pregestational and gestational diabetes is associated with risks to the mother as well as risks to the child. Risks to the mother include obesity, hypertension, and preeclampsia. Risks to the child include spontaneous abortion, fetal death, macrosomia, major congenital malformations (MCMs), preterm delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. A recent large retrospective cohort study with data from 6 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America found that, in about 51,000 women with pregestational T2DM, neither MCMs nor cardiac malformations were more prevalent in offspring of children periconceptionally exposed to second-line antidiabetic treatments relative to exposure to insulin. These findings are reassuring but have limitations that are discussed. A reasonable conclusion from a reading of the reviewed literature is that pregestational and gestational diabetes are best treated during pregnancy, that insulin is a first-line treatment, that metformin is an increasingly accepted alternative, and that safety data on second-line antidiabetic treatments are, so far, reassuring.","Chittaranjan Andrade","The Journal of clinical psychiatry","2024Mar11","Humans; Pregnancy; Female; Diabetes, Gestational; Hypoglycemic Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Heart Defects, Congenital; Infant, Newborn; Congenital Abnormalities"

We sought to evaluate whether sarcopenia predicts the development of early ASD after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). Retrospective data were collected from 109 patients who underwent TLIF from 2013 to 2023. Patients older than 18 years who underwent elective posterior midline approach TLIF were included. Patients with prior lumbar instrumented fusions, cases of trauma, central nervous system infection, cancer, or long-construct thoracolumbar deformity corrections and those who lacked sufficient follow-up were excluded. The primary outcome was radiographic ASD development within 3 years of surgery. Psoas volumetric measurements were recorded from the most recent preoperative MRI. Odds ratios were calculated with logistic regression analyses. In 109 patients undergoing elective TLIF, 22 (20.2%) developed ASD within 3 years. Gender, body mass index, and extent of surgery were not associated with ASD development. Multivariate analysis showed left/right psoas cross-sectional area, and psoas:vertebral body ratio (P:VBR) predicted early ASD (P < .0001). Sarcopenia was further categorized as having bilateral P:VBR ≥1 SD below gender mean (T-score -1). Of 18 sarcopenic patients, 15 developed early ASD (83.33%) vs 7 of 91 nonsarcopenic patients (7.69%; P < .0001). Postoperative mismatch between pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis was predictive of ASD on univariate (P = .0480) but not multivariate analysis. Pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis postoperatively were not associated with early ASD. Sarcopenia, measured by decreased psoas area and P:VBR, predicts ASD formation within 3 years of surgery. Morphometric analysis of psoas size is a simple tool to identify patients at risk of developing ASD. This information can potentially guide preoperative and postoperative therapies, affect surgical decision making, and effectively counsel patients on risks of reoperation.","Brandon M Wilkinson, Brendan Maloney, Jian Li, Hanish Polavarapu, Dan Draytsel, Ali Hazama","Neurosurgery","2024Sep26",NA
"39324787","Tobacco Use and Trigeminal Neuralgia: Clinical Features and Outcome After Microvascular Decompression.","Tobacco use is known to affect incidence and postoperative outcome for several neurosurgical disorders, but its relationship to trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is not known. We sought to identify unique population characteristics that correlate with tobacco use in a cohort of patients with TN who underwent microvascular decompression (MVD), including effect on long-term postoperative outcome. Data about 171 patients with classic TN treated with MVD were obtained from a prospectively maintained registry. Patients were classified as smokers or nonsmokers based on the use of tobacco within the 6 months before surgery. Analysis of clinical characteristics and postoperative outcome was performed. Compared with nonsmokers with TN, MVD patients using tobacco were significantly younger (53 vs 62 years, P < .01) and less likely to report pain in a single distribution of the trigeminal nerve (36% vs 65%, P < .01). There was no difference between smokers and nonsmokers in the presence of some degree of continuous pain, severity of neurovascular compression, sex, race, obesity, pain duration before presentation, immediate postoperative outcome, length of stay, or postoperative complication profile. Among 128 patients followed for at least 6 months, smokers were significantly less likely to be pain-free off medications at the last follow-up (36% vs 57%, P < .05). In patients undergoing MVD for TN, smoking is associated with younger age of TN onset, more widespread facial pain, and worse long-term postoperative outcome after MVD. These features suggest that TN in smokers may represent a more severe disease form compared with TN in nonsmokers with different responses to treatment.","Jerry Shepherd, Sean Li, Eric Herring, Collin M Labak, Jonathan P Miller","Neurosurgery","2024Sep26",NA

Follow-up time was time since switch visit (or comparable visit in controls). Linear regression mixed effect models assessed the effects of sex, group (INSTI, non-INSTI, PWOH), and time upon weight and anthropometric measurements (waist, hip, thigh).

"39324689","Beyond body mass index: Body composition profiling for perioperative risk stratification in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients.","Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) is an aggressive tumor, usually detected at an advanced stage. Our aim was to investigate the potential of body composition analysis (BCA) derived from presurgical staging computed tomography (CT) in predicting perisurgical complications. In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 86 patients who underwent CT imaging prior to liver surgery. Cox and logistic regression were performed to assess risk factors for prolonged hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays, as well as the occurrence of various complications. BCA parameters served as covariates besides conventional risk factors. Postoperative complications after resection of iCC significantly prolonged the overall length of hospitalization (p < .001). Presence of sarcopenia was associated with longer ICU stays. Complications were common, with 62.5% classified as Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa or lower and 37.5% as more severe. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were identified as risk factors for complications, including bile leakage (in 24 cases, p = .025), pleural effusions (in 26 cases, p = .025), and intra-abdominal abscess formation (in 24 cases, p = .043). SAT was associated with severe complications requiring interventional therapy, whereas VAT was correlated with abscess formation. Despite normal prevalence of obesity (22%), body mass index (BMI) did not have an impact on the development of perioperative complications. BCA is a useful tool for preoperative risk stratification in patients with iCC and is superior to BMI assessment. Increased SAT and VAT were associated with the risk of perisurgical complications, prolonging hospitalization. Therefore, BCA derived from routine staging CT should be considered in the preoperative assessment of patients with iCC.","Johannes Kolck, Clarissa Hosse, Nick Lasse Beetz, Timo Alexander Auer, Adrian Alexander Marth, Laura Segger, Felix Krenzien, Georg Lurje, Uwe Pelzer, Dominik Geisel, Wenzel Schöning, Uli Fehrenbach","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)","2024Sep","Humans; Cholangiocarcinoma; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Composition; Postoperative Complications; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Hepatectomy; Length of Stay; Sarcopenia; Adult; Intra-Abdominal Fat"

"39324337","Association between overweight/obesity and iron deficiency anaemia among women of reproductive age: a systematic review.","Numerous studies have examined the relationship between overweight/obesity and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) across diverse population groups, but a definitive link has not been clearly determined. This systematic review examined the association between overweight/obesity and IDA in women of reproductive age (WRA). The initial search was performed in the CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. The studies included should report at least one Fe status with/without an inflammatory marker, using the BMI to define overweight/obesity. Only baseline data were extracted for longitudinal studies. Global. Pregnant or non-pregnant women aged 18-50 years. In total, twenty-seven papers were included (twelve addressing pregnant women and fifteen addressing non-pregnant women). Overall, most of the studies reported no association between overweight/obesity and Hb concentration. However, a positive association was reported more frequently in pregnant women. The association between overweight/obesity and serum ferritin concentrations was mixed. Most of the studies on non-pregnant women reported a positive association. Only a few studies measured hepcidin and inflammatory markers, and the majority revealed an increased level among overweight/obese WRA. Among pregnant women, overweight/obesity was positively associated with anaemia and IDA but negatively associated with iron deficiency (ID). Meanwhile, overweight/obese non-pregnant women were positively associated with anaemia, ID and IDA. Overweight/obesity was associated with a decreased prevalence of anaemia and IDA but an increased prevalence of ID, while its association with several Fe markers was inconclusive. Further studies integrating the assessment of various Fe markers, inflammatory markers and hepcidin are needed.","Qonita Rachmah, Prasenjit Mondal, Hai Phung, Faruk Ahmed","Public health nutrition","2024Sep26","Humans; Anemia, Iron-Deficiency; Female; Pregnancy; Obesity; Adult; Overweight; Adolescent; Young Adult; Ferritins; Middle Aged; Hepcidins; Biomarkers; Body Mass Index; Hemoglobins; Iron"

The birth cohort in this area provides a unique opportunity to examine the association between maternal dietary practice and neonatal obesity. The study aims to detect the prevalence of obesity among neonates, associated with maternal diet and other factors, supporting life-course strategies for obesity control. A cohort of pregnant women was enrolled in Tibet Plateau and followed till childbirth. Dietary practice during pregnancy was assessed using the Chinese FFQ - Tibet Plateau version, food items and other variables were associated with the risk for obesity of neonates followed by logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest. Of the total 1226 mother-neonate pairs, 40·5 % were Tibetan and 5·4 % of neonates with obesity. Consuming fruits as a protective factor for obesity of neonates with OR (95 % CI) = 0·61 (0·43, 0·87) from logistic regression; as well as OR = 0·20 (0·12, 0·35) for consuming fruits (≥ weekly) from CART. Removing fruit consumption to avoid overshadowing effects of other factors, the following were influential from CART: maternal education (more than middle school, OR = 0·22 (0·13, 0·37)) and consumption of Tibetan food (daily, OR = 3·44 (2·08, 5·69). Obesity among neonates is prevalent in the study population. Promoting healthy diets during pregnancy and strengthening maternal education should be part of the life-course strategies for obesity control.","Xiao Tang, Bin Zhang, Mengzi Sun, Hong Xue, Ruihua Xu, Wenxiu Jian, Xiaomin Sun, Pinhua Wang, Jiangcuo Zhaxi, Xuejun Wang, Liehong Wang, Xinguang Chen, Yankai Xia, Youfa Wang, Wen Peng","The British journal of nutrition","2024Sep26",NA
"39324186","Associations of ""Weekend Warrior"" Physical Activity With Incident Disease and Cardiometabolic Health.","Achievement of guideline-recommended levels of physical activity (≥150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week) is associated with lower risk of adverse cardiovascular events and represents an important public health priority. Although physical activity commonly follows a ""weekend warrior"" pattern, in which most moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is concentrated in 1 or 2 days rather than spread more evenly across the week (regular), the effects of physical activity pattern across a range of incident diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions, are unknown. We tested associations between physical activity pattern and incidence of 678 conditions in 89 573 participants (62±8 years of age; 56% women) of the UK Biobank prospective cohort study who wore an accelerometer for 1 week between June 2013 and December 2015. Models were adjusted for multiple baseline clinical factors, and P value thresholds were corrected for multiplicity. When compared to inactive (<150 minutes moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week), both weekend warrior (267 total associations; 264 [99%] with lower disease risk; hazard ratio [HR] range, 0.35-0.89) and regular activity (209 associations; 205 [98%] with lower disease risk; HR range, 0.41-0.88) were broadly associated with lower risk of incident disease. The strongest associations were observed for cardiometabolic conditions such as incident hypertension (weekend warrior: HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.80]; P=1.2×10-27; regular: HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68-0.77]; P=4.5×10-28), diabetes (weekend warrior: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.62]; P=3.9×10-32; regular: HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.48-0.60]; P=8.7×10-26), obesity (weekend warrior: HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.50-0.60]; P=2.4×10-43, regular: HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.40-0.50]; P=9.6×10-47), and sleep apnea (weekend warrior: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.69]; P=1.6×10-9; regular: HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.39-0.62]; P=7.4×10-10). When weekend warrior and regular activity were compared directly, there were no conditions for which effects differed significantly. Observations were similar when activity was thresholded at the sample median (≥230.4 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week). Achievement of measured physical activity volumes consistent with guideline recommendations is associated with lower risk for >200 diseases, with prominent effects on cardiometabolic conditions.

"39324178","A growth curve model to estimate longitudinal effects of parental BMI on Indonesian children's growth patterns.","The global surge in childhood obesity is also evident in Indonesia. Parental body mass index (BMI) values were found to be one of the major determinants of the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity. It is uncertain if parental BMI during their offspring's childhood significantly affects their children's BMI trajectories into adulthood. We aimed to investigate the influence of parental BMI Z-scores on BMI trajectories of Indonesian school-aged children, with a focus on sex-specific effects. This study utilized data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey and tracked the same respondents over four time points, from wave 2 (1997-1998) to wave 5 (2014-2015). The sample of this study consisted of children aged 5-12 years in wave 2 for whom height and weight data were available. We utilized a two-level growth curve model to account for the hierarchical structure of the data, with time nested within individual children. Fathers' BMI Z-scores in wave 2 had a pronounced influence (β = 0.31) on female children's BMI Z-scores compared to the influence of mothers' BMI Z-scores (β = 0.17). Mothers' BMI Z-scores in wave 2 showed a stronger positive association with male children's BMI Z-scores (β = 0.22) than did the father's BMI Z-scores (β = 0.19). A significant interaction of fathers' BMI Z-scores and years of follow-up was found for male children. As male children's BMI Z-scores increased by year, this effect was stronger in those whose fathers' BMI Z-scores were at a higher level. In conclusion, we found that parental BMI values profoundly influenced their children's BMI trajectories.","Yoseph Leonardo Samodra, Ying-Chih Chuang","Journal of developmental origins of health and disease","2024Sep26","Humans; Body Mass Index; Male; Female; Child; Indonesia; Child, Preschool; Longitudinal Studies; Pediatric Obesity; Parents; Child Development; Adult"
"39324120","Population-based prevalence of self-reported pediatric diabetes and screening for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in Chinese children in years 2017-2019, a cross-sectional study.","The worldwide geographical and temporal variation in the prevalence of diabetes represents a challenge, but also an opportunity for gaining etiological insights. Encompassing the bulk of East Asians, a large and distinct proportion of the world population, China can be a source of valuable epidemiological insights for diabetes, especially in early life, when pathophysiology begins. We carried out a nationwide, epidemiological survey of Prevalence and Risk of Obesity and Diabetes in Youth (PRODY) in China, from 2017 to 2019, to estimate the population-based prevalence of diagnosed pediatric diabetes and screen for undiagnosed pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2D). PRODY was a nation-wide, school population-based, cross-sectional, multicenter survey by questionnaire, fasting urine glucose test and simple oral glucose tolerance test (s-OGTT), among a total number of 193,801 general-population children and adolescents (covered a pediatric population of more than 96.8 million), aged 3-18, from twelve provinces across China. The prevalence of the self-reported pediatric diabetes, the proportion of subtypes, the crude prevalence of undiagnosed T2D and prediabetes in general juvenile population and the main risk factors of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes had been analyzed in the study. The prevalence of all self-reported pediatric diabetes was estimated at 0.62/1000 (95% CI: 0.51-0.74), with T1D at 0.44/1000 (95% CI: 0.35-0.54) and T2D at 0.18/1000 (95% CI: 0.13-0.25). For undiagnosed T2D, the crude prevalence was almost ten-fold higher, at 1.59/1000, with an estimated extra 28.45/1000 of undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 53.74/1000 of undiagnosed impaired fasting glucose (IFG) by s-OGTT screening. Maternal diabetes history is the major risk factors for all subtypes of pediatric diabetes in China. The PRODY study provides the first population-based estimate of the prevalence of pediatric diabetes China and reveals a magnitude of the problem of undiagnosed pediatric T2D. We propose a practical screening strategy by s-OGTT to address this serious gap.

"39324013","Chronic Pain and Obesity in Community-Dwelling Adults: Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.","Chronic pain and obesity, together with their corresponding characteristics, are concerning health issues with high socioeconomic burden. The objective of this study is to ascertain the prevalence of chronic pain among individuals residing in the community and examine its association with obesity. The present study employed a cross-sectional design and analyzed data from three cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to examine the relationship between chronic pain and obesity. To evaluate the potential nonlinear association of chronic with body mass index (BMI), the restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was performed in multivariable-adjusted models. The researchers conducted subgroup analyses in order to investigate the potential influence of different confounding factors on the relationship between chronic pain and obesity. Our final analysis included a sample size of 13,700 participants with higher prevalence of chronic pain with higher BMI, older age, female sex, lower educational level, smoking, and other pathologies. The prevalence of chronic pain in different BMI groups was 17.0% (underweight), 11.8% (normal weight), 12.9% (overweight), and 17.9% (obesity), respectively. In the fully adjusted model, obesity was associated with a 45% increase in the risk of chronic pain compared with the normal weight. The RCS analyses revealed a nonlinear and J-shaped positive association between BMI and chronic pain (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27-1.66, all P for nonlinearity < 0.05). The results of the subgroup analyses indicate that the presence of osteoporosis significantly influenced the relationship between obesity and chronic pain, as evidenced by a statistically significant interaction effect (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38-3.68, P for interaction = 0.019). The presence of obesity was found to be significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of experiencing chronic pain among adults living in the United States.","Yuting Zhong, Kejun Tian, Yunya Zhu, Ying Li","Journal of pain research","2024",NA
"39323881","Complete genome sequence and anti-obesity potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HOM2217 in 3T3-L1 cells and high-fat diet-fed rats.","The global prevalence of obesity is rising year by year, which has become a public health problem worldwide. Many animal and clinical studies have shown that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is considered an ideal probiotic and potential supplement for the treatment of obesity. In this study, we aimed to complete the genome sequence of L. plantarum HOM2217, which was isolated from human milk, and study its physiological characteristics and anti-obesity effects in 3T3-L1 cells and rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to determine its potential as a starter for functional food products. Whole-genome analysis demonstrated that HOM2217 contained a single circular chromosome of 3,267,529 bp with a GC content of 44.5% and one plasmid (62,350 bp) with a GC content of 38.5%. Compared to the reference strains, HOM2217 demonstrated superior tolerance to gastrointestinal conditions, higher adhesion to intestinal epithelial cell lines, potent antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, and effective cholesterol removal ability in vitro. Treatment with heat-killed HOM2217 significantly reduced lipid accumulation and intracellular triglyceride production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Daily treatment of HFD-fed rats with HOM2217 for 7 weeks decreased body weight, body weight gain, and body fat without changes in food intake. HOM2217 also significantly increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, decreased the serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and increased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) (formic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid) levels in the cecum. Thus, HOM2217 could potentially prevent obesity in rats by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating lipid metabolism and SCFAs expression. Therefore, HOM2217 has potential as an alternative treatment for obesity.","Tingting Wang, Xiao Zhang, Linlin Fan, Ying Zhao, Zhengwen Zhang, Zhonghua Cao, Ying Xu, Suwon Lee, Chongyoon Lim, Shiqi Zhang","Frontiers in microbiology","2024",NA

The median (IQR) diagnostic delay was 10.1 (6-18) months, body mass index was 25.4 (23-49), and forced vital capacity was 72% (52%-87%). Approximately 12% of patients tested carried a pathologic C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Median (IQR) ALS functional rating scale-revised score was 35 (29-40) and ALS cognitive behavioral screen score was 15 (12-17). The median (IQR) survival after diagnosis was 17.2 (9-31) months, and survival from symptom onset was 30 (20-48) months. We found that older age decreased forced vital capacity, and fast-progressing ALS functional rating scale-revised scores significantly (P<.0001) influence survival curves and associated hazard risk. Although results obtained from our cohort are consistent with other reports (eg, men with spinal onset experience a longer survival than women with bulbar onset), they remind us of the complexity of the disease's natural history and the limited prognostic power of the most common clinical predictors.","Erica Engelberg-Cook, Jaimin S Shah, Andre Teixeira da Silva Hucke, Diana V Vera-Garcia, Jany E Dagher, Megan H Donahue, Veronique V Belzil, Björn Oskarsson","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

"39323751","Racial disparities in TAVR outcomes in patients with cancer.","Advances in cancer therapies and improvement in survival of cancer patients have led to a growing number of patients with both cancer and severe aortic stenosis (AS). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment option for this patient population. There are established racial disparities in utilization and outcomes of both cancer treatments and TAVR. However, the effect of race on TAVR outcomes in cancer patients has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate racial disparities in outcomes of TAVR in cancer patients. 343 patients with cancer who underwent TAVR at a single center over a 6-year period were included in the study. The primary endpoint was a composite of 1-year mortality, stroke, and bleeding. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary endpoint as well as 30-day mortality, structural complications, vascular access complications, and conduction system complications. Outcomes were compared between black and white patients by comparing incidence rates. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, medical comorbidities, STS score, and echocardiographic parameters were similar between races, aside from significantly higher rates of CKD (50.0% vs. 26.6%, p = 0.005) and ESRD (18.4% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.005) in black compared to white cancer patients. There was a trend toward worse outcomes in black cancer patients with regard to a composite endpoint of 1-year mortality, stroke, and major bleeding (35.7% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.095), primarily driven by higher 1-year mortality (31.0% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.065). 30-day mortality was twice as high in black cancer patients than in white cancer patients (4.8% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.018). There is a trend toward worse TAVR outcomes in black cancer patients, with higher periprocedural complication rates and mortality, compared to white cancer patients.

We hypothesized that teaching children about heart-healthy habits would increase their activity levels and improve their desire to be active. This was a longitudinal survey study. Children at local after-school programs were given a pre-survey, the Kids' Activity and Nutrition Questionnaire (KAN-Q), to assess their activity levels, diet, and knowledge of heart health. The children had a 15-minute educational period followed by an interactive program. Students completed the same survey at each of the three sessions. A total of 44 children answered the survey questions at the beginning of each session. Out of the 10 behavioral questions, six indicated a favorable shift towards adopting healthier habits. Whole grain consumption increased to 71% from 32% (p<0.01). Vegetable consumption increased from 39% to 88%, and fruit consumption increased from 68% to 92% (p<0.01). There was a 30% decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks (p<0.01), and a reduction in hours watching television (p=0.05). All four knowledge-based questions had an increase in correct responses across the three sessions (p<0.01). To augment behavior, a dual approach of education on nutrition and exercise leads to improved nutrition choices and exercise habits for primary prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in elementary school-aged children.

It is still unclear how diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and CAN are related. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of CAN in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had isolated DPN without other microvascular or macrovascular complications. Methodology A total of 35 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with isolated DPN (group 1) and an equal number of sex- and age-matched patients without DPN (group 2) underwent CAN testing. Results were compared between the two groups. Results A significantly higher prevalence of isolated parasympathetic (28.57 vs. 11.42%), isolated sympathetic (22.85 vs. 8.57%), and combined autonomic dysfunction (37.14 vs. 2.85%) was found in the neuropathic group compared to the non-neuropathic group. Group 1 exhibited more abnormal parasympathetic nervous system test results and increased diastolic pressure during sustained handgrip compared to group 2 (all p-values <0.05). Conclusions A significantly higher prevalence of cardiac autonomic dysfunction is seen in patients with DPN without other microvascular or macrovascular complications, irrespective of age, sex, or duration of diabetes mellitus.

The mean DMFT scores among adequately nourished children were 2.4086; with severely malnourished and severely obese children, the mean values were found to be 1.0652 and 1.4286, respectively. The mean SFR among children with adequate nutrition was 1.0366, and the mean flow rate among children with severe malnutrition and obesity was 0.5348 and 0.4036, respectively. The mean salivary pH among children with adequate nutrition was 7.1295, and the mean values for participants with severe malnutrition and severe obesity were found to be 6.4772 and 7.6521, respectively. The mean SBC among children with adequate nutrition was found to be 4.4861; for severely malnourished children and those with severe obesity, the values were 3.2472 and 2.8332, respectively. There was an absence of enamel hypoplasia in children with adequate nutrition, whereas a total of five participants with severe malnutrition and three children with severe obesity were found to have hypoplastic lesions, respectively.

In this paper, attempts have been made to examine the maternal health status and to identify the factors responsible for poor health status among SC and ST women. The study is purely based on secondary data taken from latest 3 rounds of NFHS (2005-6, 2015-16 & 2019-21). Multivariate analysis have been carried out using panel regression model to understand the impact of determinants on maternal healthcare. The study found that the SC and ST women are more prone to anemia than others (GENERAL category women). Maternal health status is mostly controlled by per capita health expenditure and health infrastructure variables like no. of hospitals and nurses, irrespective of social class. Thus poor maternal health status in India, especially among socially disadvantaged groups of society, have been major concern.

Uterine manipulators are commonly used to handle the uterus during laparoscopic surgery, but few studies have examined their necessity in RSH. This study retrospectively compares RSH cases with and without the use of manipulators, and identifies predictors for their intraoperative use. This retrospective cohort study included patients undergoing RSH for benign pathologies at Kawasaki Medical School from October 2020 to December 2022. Patients with malignancies were excluded. The robotic surgeries were performed by three skilled surgeons using the four-arm da Vinci Xi surgical system. Data on perioperative and operative parameters were collected, including age, body mass index (BMI), history of abdominal surgery, disease type, presence of ovarian cysts, and operative time. Statistical analyses were performed using EZR software, with multivariate logistic regression to identify predictive factors for uterine manipulator use. The study included 113 patients who underwent RSH without a uterine manipulator and 58 with one. Patients without a manipulator were older, while those with a manipulator had higher BMIs and a higher prevalence of ovarian chocolate cysts and Douglas obliteration. Operating time was shorter without a manipulator. Independent predictors for manipulator use were higher BMI, presence of ovarian endometrioid cysts, and Douglas obliteration. RSH without a uterine manipulator is feasible and can reduce the need for surgical assistants. Predictors for manipulator use include higher BMI, ovarian cysts, and Douglas obliteration. The use of a fourth robotic arm can enhance surgical independence and resource efficiency.

Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables using χ 2 with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The significant covariates (independent variables) were matched in both groups by propensity score matching, followed by multivariate regression analysis. Of the 415 patients screened, 109 HCV patients and 97 non-HCV patients with colonoscopy results were included in the study. HCV patients were older, had a smoking history, had less frequent aspirin use, and had a lower body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.05). The HCV cohort had a significantly increased number of patients with adenomas (adenoma detection rate of 53.2% vs 34%. P = 0.006). We performed a propensity-matched multivariate analysis where HCV infection was significantly associated with colorectal adenoma (OR: 2.070, P = 0.019). Our study shows a significantly higher rate of adenomas in HCV patients compared to the general population. Prospective studies would help determine if the increase in adenoma detection lowers the risk for colorectal cancer.","Maya Gogtay, Lekha Yadukumar, Yuvaraj Singh, Mithil Gowda Suresh, Aakriti Soni, Anuroop Yekula, Asha Bullappa, George M Abraham","World journal of virology","2024Sep25",NA
"39323373","Evaluating Weight Status, Snacking Patterns, and Physical Activity Levels Among Primary Schoolchildren in Relizane, Algeria: A Comprehensive Analysis.","This study aimed to comprehensively assess the weight status, snack consumption, and physical activity levels among primary schoolchildren, with a focus on both rural and urban areas. This cross-sectional study surveyed 557 primary schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years, covering general identification (age, gender), anthropometric measurements (body weight, height, waist, and hip circumference), food patterns (frequency of food consumption), and sports activities. Using CDC body mass index thresholds, we identified a 25% prevalence of obesity and over 17% for overweight, revealing a significant urban-rural disparity. In urban areas, boys had a higher obesity rate (32.58%), while girls had a higher overweight rate (15%). Conversely, in rural regions, girls had a higher obesity rate (24.82%), and boys had a higher overweight rate (22.3%). Dietary analysis showed that over 86% consumed three daily meals, but distinctions in snack choices, such as chips, wafers, and biscuits, were noted between urban and rural areas. Additionally, urban schoolchildren were more likely to participate in sports activities compared to their rural counterparts, with rates of 70.22% versus 55.08%, respectively. Findings provide valuable insights into the health and food behaviors of primary schoolchildren and can inform interventions and strategies to promote healthier lifestyles.","Zouheyr Hadri, M'hamed Benada, Boualem Boumaaza, Sofiane Boudalia","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)","2024Sep26",NA
"39323366","An internet-based platform with a low-calorie dietary intervention improves cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese people in China: Half-year follow-up results of a randomized controlled trial.","To explore the effectiveness of the Metawell programme on cardiometabolic risk factors in China, which combines meal replacement biscuits, a wireless scale, and a mobile phone application. In this two-arm, parallel-design randomized study, 220 participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 110) and a control (n = 110) group. Participants in the intervention group were instructed to use meal replacement products and scales for weight loss and monitoring, whereas participants in the control group received printed materials containing a sample diet and face-to-face weight loss education at enrolment. The trial lasted 6 months, including a weight loss period in Months 1-3 and a weight maintenance period in Months 3-6. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare differences between the two groups. The median (interquartile range) ages of the intervention and control groups were 32.00 (28.00, 39.00) years and 33.00 (28.25, 41.00) years, with body mass indices of 28.20 (26.30, 30.95) kg/m2 and 27.70 (26.02, 29.70) kg/m2, respectively. Participants in the intervention group experienced significantly greater decreases in waist circumference, hip circumference, triglycerides, total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Among participants who did not regain weight during the maintenance period after weight loss, the reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The Metawell programme of caloric restriction and remote monitoring can be adapted to overweight and obese people in China to reduce their cardiometabolic risk factors. Furthermore, there was a better improvement in blood pressure in participants who maintained the effects of weight loss.","Yang Zhong, Xi Wang, Suyuan Wang, Linyu Zhong, Yanhong Guo, Chenghui Zhang, Hua He, Yunhong Wu","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","2024Sep26",NA

We examined prospective cohort data from three consecutive waves of the Health, Aging and Retirement in Thailand (HART) study (analytic sample size = 2863) for participants 45 years of age and older. Meal-skipping was assessed with a one- and two-day recall of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We used generalized estimating equations analysis to evaluate the longitudinal relationships between sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health indicators and meal-skipping between 2015 (wave 1), 2017 (wave 2), and 2020 (wave 3). Furthermore, binary logistic regression was used to establish the longitudinal association between meal-skipping and the incidence of multiple chronic conditions. The prevalence of meal-skipping was 6.2% in 2015, 16.2% in 2017, and 13.6% in 2020, and across study years the highest proportion of meal skipping was for lunch (6.0%), followed by breakfast (4.6%), and dinner (2.8%). In the final model, sociodemographic factors (higher education, urban residence, and lower subjective economic status), lifestyle factors (high alcohol use, current smoking, and obesity class II), and health indicators (probable depression and wearing dentures) were positively associated with meal-skipping. In the adjusted logistic regression models, compared with no meal-skipping, meal-skipping in 2-3 study waves was associated with incident obesity and incident probable depression. Skipping meals was linked to a number of lifestyle variables and indicators of physical and mental illness.

"39323217","Trajectories of daily antipsychotic use and weight gain in people hospitalized for the first episode of psychosis.","We need to better understand the risk factors and predictors of medication-related weight gain to improve metabolic health of individuals with schizophrenia. This study explores how trajectories of antipsychotic medication (AP) use impact body weight early in the course of schizophrenia. We recruited 92 participants with first-episode psychosis (FEP, n = 92) during their first psychiatric hospitalization. We prospectively collected weight, body mass index (BMI), metabolic markers, and exact daily medication exposure during 6-week hospitalization. We quantified the trajectory of AP medication changes and AP polypharmacy using a novel approach based on meta-analytical ranking of medications and tested it as a predictor of weight gain together with traditional risk factors. Most people started treatment with risperidone (n = 57), followed by olanzapine (n = 29). Then, 48% of individuals remained on their first prescribed medication, while 33% of people remained on monotherapy. Almost half of the individuals (39/92) experienced escalation of medications, mostly switch to AP polypharmacy (90%). Only baseline BMI was a predictor of BMI change. Individuals in the top tercile of weight gain, compared to those in the bottom tercile, showed lower follow-up symptoms, a trend for longer prehospitalization antipsychotic treatment, and greater exposure to metabolically problematic medications. Early in the course of illness, during inpatient treatment, baseline BMI is the strongest and earliest predictor of weight gain on APs and is a better predictor than type of medication, polypharmacy, or medication switches. Baseline BMI predicted weight change over a period of weeks, when other traditional predictors demonstrated a much smaller effect.","Kristyna Vochoskova, Sean R McWhinney, Marketa Fialova, Marian Kolenic, Filip Spaniel, Petra Furstova, Petra Boron, Yurai Okaji, Pavel Trancik, Tomas Hajek","European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists","2024Sep26","Humans; Antipsychotic Agents; Weight Gain; Female; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Adult; Hospitalization; Body Mass Index; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; Risperidone; Olanzapine; Polypharmacy; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"39322993","Di (2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate and its metabolite-induced metabolic syndrome: a review of molecular mechanisms.","Metabolic disorders, as multifactorial disorders, are induced by genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental chemicals. Di (2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a ubiquitous plasticizer, is well known as an endocrine-disrupting chemical in living organisms. In recent decades, researchers have focused on the potential of DEHP and its main metabolite (Mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) (MEHP) to induce metabolic disorders. In the present review, we aimed to summarize studies regarding DEHP and MEHP-induced Metabolic syndrome (MetS) as well as address the involved mechanisms. A search has been carried out in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using appropriate keywords including 'Metabolic syndrome' or 'Metabolic disorder' or 'Obesity' or 'Hyperglycemia' or 'Hyperlipidemia' or 'Hypertension' or 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease' and 'DEHP' or 'Di (2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate' or 'Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate' or 'MEHP' or 'Mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate'. Studies were chosen based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria are in vitro, in vivo, epidemiological studies, and English-written studies. Exclusion criteria are lack of access to the full text of studies, editorial articles, review articles, and conference articles. Animal studies indicate that DEHP and MEHP disrupt insulin hemostasis, increase glucose content, and induce hyperlipidemia and hypertension as well as obesity, which could lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). DEHP and its metabolite induce such effects directly through influence on nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) or indirectly through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both events led to the disruption of several molecular signaling pathways and subsequently metabolic syndrome (MetS). Furthermore, epidemiological studies showed that there was a correlation between DEHP metabolites levels and obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. According to studies, DEHP and its main metabolite have the potential to induce MetS by involving various molecular mechanisms. Epidemiological studies concerning the association of DEHP and MetS in humans are not sufficient. Therefore, more studies are needed in this regard.","Sorour Ashaari, Tannaz Jamialahmadi, Neal M Davies, Wael Almahmeed, Amirhossein Sahebkar","Drug and chemical toxicology","2024Sep25",NA
"39322921","Large-scale genome-wide interaction analyses on multiple cardiometabolic risk factors to identify age-specific genetic risk factors.","The genetic landscape of cardiometabolic risk factors has been explored extensively. However, insight in the effects of genetic variation on these risk factors over the life course is sparse. Here, we performed genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) on different cardiometabolic risk factors to identify age-specific genetic risks. This study included 270,276 unrelated European-ancestry participants from the UK Biobank (54.2% women, a median age of 58 [interquartile range (IQR): 50, 63] years). GWIS models with interaction terms between genetic variants and age were performed on apolipoprotein B (ApoB), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), log-transformed triglycerides (TG), body mass index (BMI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Replication was subsequently performed in the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) and the Estonian Biobank (EstBB). Multiple lead variants were identified to have genome-wide significant interactions with age (Pinteraction < 1e - 08). In detail, rs429358 (tagging APOE4) was identified for ApoB (Pinteraction = 9.0e - 14) and TG (Pinteraction = 5.4e - 16). Three additional lead variants were identified for ApoB: rs11591147 (R46L in PCSK9, Pinteraction = 3.9e - 09), rs34601365 (near APOB, Pinteraction = 8.4e - 09) and rs17248720 (near LDLR, Pinteraction = 2.0e - 09). Effect sizes of the identified lead variants were generally closer to the null with increasing age. No variant-age interactions were identified for LDL-C, SBP and BMI. The significant interactions of rs429358 with age on ApoB and TG were replicated in both CGPS and EstBB. The majority of genetic effects on cardiometabolic risk factors remain relatively constant over age, with the noted exceptions of specific genetic effects on ApoB and TG.","Linjun Ao, Diana van Heemst, Jiao Luo, Maris Teder-Laving, Reedik Mägi, Ruth Frikke-Schmidt, Ko Willems van Dijk, Raymond Noordam","GeroScience","2024Sep25",NA

Its development is associated with pain, scar complications, adjuvant therapy delays, the need for outpatient visits, and increased care costs. Assess seroma incidence and risk factors in women undergoing mastectomies. This study comprises a prospective cohort encompassing women aged 18 or over undergoing mastectomies as a breast cancer treatment. Patients underwent physiotherapy on the 1st, 7th, and 30th postoperative days for kinetic-functional, skin, and wound healing assessments and were attended to by nurses for surgical wound care, draining liquid on the 7th, 14th, and 21st postoperative days. Seroma was defined as the presence of local fluctuations requiring puncture, regardless of the punctured volume. A total of 249 women were evaluated, with a mean age of 57.5 (SD = 11.8). A total of 77.1% were classified as overweight or obese, 60.2% were hypertensive, 21.3% were diabetic, 66.7% underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 62.7% underwent axillary lymphadenectomies. Seroma incidence was 71.1%, requiring, on average, two aspiration punctures until condition resolution. Overweight or obese women and those who underwent axillary lymphadenectomies exhibited 1.92- and 2.06-fold higher risk for seroma development (OR = 1.92; 95% CI 1.02-3.61; p = 0.042; and OR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.17-3.63; p = 0.012), respectively. Seroma incidence was very high. Being overweight or obese and undergoing axillary lymphadenectomy comprise independent seroma development risk factors.

More recently, AGILE3 + and AGILE4 have combined LSM with clinical parameters to identify patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively. However, there are limited data on prognostic performance of these scores in key at-risk subgroups such as those with diabetes and obesity compared to LSM alone. This is a retrospective cohort study including 1903 adult patients with NAFLD from tertiary care centers in the United States and Singapore undergoing VCTE between 2015 and 2022. Primary predictors were FAST, LSM, AGILE3 + , and AGILE4 scores and the primary outcome was liver-related events (LRE). Patients were further stratified by diabetes and obesity status. Prognostic performance was measured using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (tAUC) at 5 years. In total, 25 LRE occurred and the overall incidence rate of LRE was 4.4 per 1000 person-years. tAUC for predicting LRE in the overall group was significantly higher with AGILE3 + (0.94 [95% CI: 0.90-0.98]) and AGILE4 (0.94 [95% CI: 0.90-0.98]) compared to LSM (0.87 [95% CI: 0.80-0.94]) (p = 0.001 and 0.009, respectively) and FAST (0.73 [95% CI: 0.59-0.86]) (p < 0.001 for both). Similarly, tAUC was significantly higher in those with T2D for AGILE3 + compared to LSM (0.92 vs 0.86, respectively) (p = 0.015) and FAST (0.92 vs 0.73, respectively) (p = 0.008). Among people with obesity, tAUC was significantly higher for AGILE3 + compared to LSM (0.95 vs 0.89, respectively) (p = 0.005) and FAST (0.95 vs 0.76, respectively) (p = 0.0035). Though AGILE4 had a higher tAUC in these subgroups compared to LSM, it did not reach statistical significance.

"39322613","Identification and stratification of placenta percreta with gynecologic oncologist management.","Gynecologic oncologist involvement in the surgical team of patients with placenta percreta has shown improved patient outcomes. Yet, stratification of cases is dependent on identification of placenta percreta by ultrasonography which has a poor detection rate. To allow patients to receive optimal team management by pre-operative stratification our objective was to identify the pre-operative characteristics of patients with previously underdiagnosed placenta percreta. A retrospective single institution case-control study was performed from January 2010 to December 2022 of singleton, non-anomalous pregnancies with suspicion for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). Ultrasonography was used as the primary method of detection. Final inclusion was dependent on histology confirmation of PAS and degree of invasion. We explored the role of concurrent antenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on patients with previously unrecognized placenta percreta. During the 13 year study period, 140 cases of histologically confirmed PAS were managed by our team and met inclusion criteria. A total of 72 (51.4%) cases were for placenta percreta and 27 (37.5%) of these were diagnosed pre-operatively while 45 (62.5%) were only diagnosed post-operatively. Comparison between these two groups revealed patient body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 was independently associated with unrecognized placenta percreta (p=0.006). No findings by MRI were associated with mischaracterization of placenta percreta. Yet, concurrent MRI assessment of patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 (n=18), increased placenta percreta detection by 11 cases (61%). The ability to determine pre-operatively which patients are more likely to have placenta percreta allows for gynecologic oncologists to be involved in the most complex cases in a planned manner. This study shows that women at risk for placenta accreta spectrum, who are obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), may benefit from further assessment with pre-operative MRI to facilitate appropriate staffing and team availability for cases of placenta percreta.","Jessian Louis Munoz, Logan Michelle Blankenship, Kayla Evonne Ireland, Patrick Shannon Ramsey, Georgia A McCann","International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society","2024Sep25",NA
"39322582","Serum isthmin-1 is a potential biomarker for metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease in patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a prevalent condition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Isthmin-1 (ISM1) is an adipokine that promotes glucose uptake and improves glucose tolerance and hepatic steatosis. Although ISM1 has been shown to be associated with T2DM, its role in patients with MAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum ISM1 and MAFLD in patients with T2DM and the potential involvement of MetS in this association. A total of 250 participants were divided into four groups: 60 patients with T2DM and MAFLD, 60 with newly diagnosed T2DM, 60 with MAFLD, and 70 healthy controls. Serum ISM1 levels were measured using ELISA. The distribution of ISM1 concentration in the combined data was divided into quartiles, and the Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed to estimate the significant trends across increasing quartiles. Compared with the controls, patients with coexisting MAFLD, MetS, and T2DM exhibited significantly elevated serum ISM1 concentrations. Serum ISM1 levels in the overweight/obese group were also higher than those in the lean group. Serum ISM1 levels were positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and negatively associated with age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). BMI, TC, and HDL-C were independently associated with serum ISM1 concentration. The relative risks for MAFLD, T2DM, and T2DM with MAFLD increased significantly with higher ISM1 quartiles. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between serum ISM1 levels and the number of MetS components, with the elevated plasma levels of ISM1 escalating the risk of developing MetS to some extent. The combination of ISM1 with TG and UA was identified as the best predictive factor for diagnosing MAFLD and MetS, potentially due to their contribution to aggravating the metabolic state.","Xiaohui Lei, HaiYan Chen, YuXin Xu, Zhuoran Yang, Lili Zhang, Cong Wang, Hu Du","BMJ open diabetes research & care","2024Sep25","Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Liver; Follow-Up Studies; Insulin Resistance; Metabolic Syndrome; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prognosis"

This is a prospective cohort study with a mean follow-up period of 3.2 (±0.34) years, involving 109 (60 girls and 49 boys) Brazilian adolescents. Body mass index, waist circumference, and cardiorespiratory fitness were the cardiovascular risk factors considered. A cardiovascular risk score was calculated. Sedentary bouts, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured by accelerometers. Multivariate linear regression models adopting the isotemporal substitution were used to analyze the association between substitution of 10 minutes per day of sedentary bouts with LPA and MVPA and risk factors. All analyses considered 5% significance levels. Substitutions of SB, short and long bouts, with MVPA were associated with higher cardiorespiratory fitness in boys (β = 0.077; 95% confidence interval, 0.001 to 0.55; β = 0.076; 95% confidence interval, 0.003 to 0.154; and β = 0.084; 95% confidence interval, 0.001 to 0.167, respectively). No associations were observed when analyses involved substitution of sedentary bouts with LPA, adiposity, cardiovascular risk score, and girls. Substituting SB bouts with MVPA appears to favorably influence changes of cardiorespiratory fitness in boys during adolescence. Greater benefits appear to occur when longer sedentary bouts are substituted by MVPA.","Leonardo Alex Volpato, Vinícius Muller Reis Weber, Wendell Arthur Lopes, Jeffer Eidi Sasaki, Catiana Leila Possamai Romanzini, Enio Ricardo Vaz Ronque, Marcelo Romanzini","Journal of physical activity & health","2024Sep24",NA

"39322091","Gestational diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and cardiometabolic multimorbidity: a prospective cohort study.","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) could increase the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. However, evidence on its association with cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) was limited. This study aimed to evaluate the association between GDM and the prevalence, incidence, patterns, and progression of CMM; and the role of body mass index (BMI) in such association. This study included 203,372 women who have given birth in UK Biobank. The diagnoses of GDM and cardiometabolic diseases (including stroke, coronary heart disease [CHD], and T2DM) were reported by participants or obtained through linkage to inpatient hospital data until 31st December 2020. BMI was assessed at the baseline assessment. CMM was defined as having two or more of included cardiometabolic diseases. Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between GDM and CMM, and the modifications on both additive and multiplicative scales were assessed to evaluate the effect of BMI on such association. A total of 1,217 women had a history of GDM, 2,351 participants had CMM at the end of follow-up and 1,601 was newly diagnosed during follow-up. GDM was associated with higher prevalence (odds ratio [OR]=4.64, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=3.54-6.08) and incidence (hazard ratio [HR]=3.62, 95% CI=2.62-5.00) of CMM. In particular, GDM was associated with higher odds of T2DM, coexisting T2DM and vascular disease, and T2DM followed by vascular disease. Formal testing for effect modification suggested multiplicative modification by BMI for the association between GDM and incident CMM. GDM was associated with CMM in women's late life, with multiplicative modification effects of BMI. Our results suggest that maternal and lifestyle interventions (e.g., weight management) are warranted for the primary and secondary prevention of CMM, particularly in women with a history of GDM.","Yue Zhang, Qingqing Tao, Yangyang Cheng, Muhammad Fawad, Zhaoxia Liang, Xiaolin Xu","Annals of epidemiology","2024Sep23",NA
"39322005","Does Use of GLP-1 Agonists Increase Postoperative Complications in Patients Undergoing Shoulder Arthroplasty?","Amidst the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity among individuals undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), the impact of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapy on surgical outcomes merits thorough investigation. Though it is known that GLP-1 therapy poses an interesting challenge for anesthesia during the perioperative period, little is known regarding the effects of these medications on surgical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of GLP-1 on postoperative outcomes and length of stay (LOS) in T2DM patients undergoing TSA. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using a national database to identify primary TSA patients aged 18 and above with T2DM prescribed GLP-1 therapy at the time of surgery. Exclusion criteria included revision surgery, TSA for fracture, type 1 diabetes, steroid-induced diabetes, and contraindications for GLP-1 therapy. A control group of T2DM TSA patients not on GLP-1 therapy was used, and a 1:4 propensity-score match was performed. Incidence rates and odds ratios (OR) via multivariable logistic regression were calculated. The primary outcomes were 90-day major medical complications and LOS. Secondary outcomes included 2-year joint-related complications. In the 90-day follow-up cohort, 64,567 patients met inclusion criteria, with 8,481 (13.1%) on GLP-1 therapy. No significant increase in 90-day major complications, including DVT, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, hypoglycemic event, sepsis, or readmission, was found between GLP-1 and non-GLP-1 cohorts after multivariable logistic regression. In the 2-year follow-up cohort, 47,814 patients were included, with 5,969 (12.5%) on GLP-1 therapy. Similarly, 2-year joint-related complications, including all-cause revision, prosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture, and aseptic revision, showed no significant differences between the GLP-1 and non-GLP-1 cohorts. No significant difference was observed in LOS in the 90-day cohort. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of GLP-1 therapy's impact on TSA outcomes, revealing no significant change in postoperative complications or LOS. The lack of increased postoperative risk underscores the potential of GLP-1 therapy in managing T2DM without adverse effects on TSA recovery. These insights contribute to understanding postoperative management in orthopedic surgery, indicating that we did not note any increased risk with GLP-1 use perioperatively in TSA patients, unlike in other populations like the TKA patients. Future research should focus on prospective analyses to further elucidate the role of GLP-1 therapy in surgical outcomes, aiming to enhance patient care and optimize postoperative strategies for T2DM patients undergoing TSA.","Zaid Elsabbagh, Mark Haft, Sudarsan Murali, Matthew Best, Edward George McFarland, Uma Srikumaran","Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery","2024Sep23",NA
"39321997","Evaluation of continuous positive airway pressure adherence and its contributing factors.","Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence may vary based on the study design and country. To investigate long-term CPAP adherence and elucidate associated factors. A multicenter retrospective observational cohort study was conducted over two years. The study included patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea who were prescribed CPAP (n = 1261). Adherence was assessed for 90 days and 365 days. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) criteria (≥4 h/night on ≥70 % of nights) and research adherence criteria (≥4 h/night during the observational period) were used. Factors influencing CPAP adherence (CMS criteria) during 90 and 365 days were also evaluated. Continuous variables were categorized into low, middle, and high classes, and logistic regression analysis with interaction was performed. CPAP adherence to CMS criteria for 90 and 365 days was 45.6 % and 44.7 %, respectively, whereas adherence to research criteria was 57.0 % and 54.1 %, respectively. Middle age, high age, and high apnea ratio independently increased CPAP adherence. Conversely, a high rapid eye movement apnea-hypopnea index ratio decreased CPAP adherence. Although high body mass index (BMI) had no independent effect on adherence, its interaction with high 3 % oxygen desaturation index increased 90-day CPAP adherence. However, high BMI decreased 90-day CPAP adherence in males. The interaction between middle age and high BMI was associated with decreased CPAP adherence over 365 days. Adherence to CPAP in real-world settings is modest. Various factors influence CPAP adherence. BMI may exert varied effects on CPAP adherence depending on the accompanying factors.","Yukio Fujita, Motoo Yamauchi, Eriko Hamada, Azusa Ikegami, Ryutaro Shirahama, Toshio Takaoka, Tsuguo Nishijima, Naoki Ozu, Masanori Yoshikawa, Shigeo Muro","Respiratory medicine","2024Sep23",NA
"39321983","Association of adolescent obesity with Anxiety, Depression and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder in the Arab population in Israel - a nationwide study.","The health ramifications of adolescent obesity are understudied in the Israeli Arab population, and the impact of ethnicity on the association of obesity with mental health problems is unclear. To examine the association of weight categories with Anxiety, Depression and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among Arab adolescents in Israel and to compare this association to a Jewish comparison group. A cross-sectional nationwide study of 313,936 Arab adolescents aged 14-19 years between the years 2007-2022, and 289,616 Jewish adolescents in a comparison group. The aORs for Anxiety, Depression and ADHD in Arab adolescents increased from a reference 'normal weight' category to 'class 3 obesity', reaching aORs (95 % CI) of 1.31 (1.16-1.47), 1.64 (1.31-2.02) and 1.51 (1.40-1.63) in 'class 2 obesity', and 1.51 (1.20-1.87), 2.81(2.00-3.84) and 1.69 (1.45-1.96) in 'class 3 obesity', respectively. The dose-dependent association between weight categories and psychiatric comorbidity was confirmed in sensitivity analyses with comorbidity with the purchase of medications serving as the dependent variable. The Jewish comparison group demonstrated a comparable increment in aORs with increase in weight category. The association between excessive weight categories and psychiatric comorbidities was stronger in Arab females, than in males. Relying on the recorded weight and height measurements and the diagnoses of psychiatric comorbidity could lead to bias. The study findings emphasize the need to relate to the mental health of adolescents with excessive weight, which can improve their overall quality of life and the success of adolescent weight loss intervention programs.","Yulia Treister-Goltzman, Idan Menashe, Dan Nemet","Journal of affective disorders","2024Sep23",NA
"39321922","The relationship between diet quality and 21-year cumulative healthcare costs among women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.","The relationships between diet quality and healthcare costs have not been explored beyond 15-years. To investigate relationships between both baseline diet quality and change in diet quality over time with cumulative data on healthcare claims and costs over 21-years among Australian Women. This is a secondary analysis of data from a cohort study, the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Data for women born 1946-51 included diet quality data at baseline (2001, n=8,228), change in diet quality (2001-2013, n=6,553) and cumulative administrative healthcare data (2001-2021). Diet quality was assessed using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) and the Fruit and Vegetable Variety Score. Twenty-one-year cumulative Medicare Benefits Schedule data (number of claims; total charges [$USD]), Australia's universal healthcare coverage, were reported by baseline ARFS quintile and category of diet quality change ('diet quality worsened' [ARFS decrease≤-4 points], 'remained stable' [-3≤change in ARFS≤3 points] or 'improved' [ARFS increase≥4 points]). Linear regression analyses were conducted and adjusted for socioeconomic, health and lifestyle factors. Higher baseline vegetable ARFS were correlated with fewer 21-year cumulative Medicare claims (β= -4.9, 95%CI -7.3,-2.4) and charges (β= -$USD214, 95%CI -$USD341,-$USD88). Baseline higher dairy scores were correlated with higher Medicare claims (β= 17.2, 95%CI 11.1,23.3) and charges (β= $USD762, 95%CI $USD448,$USD1,076). Compared to women whose diet quality score remained stable, those whose diet quality worsened over time made significantly more claims and higher charges; median [Q1,Q3] 413 [277,588] claims, $USD17,868 [$USD11,037,$USD27,808] cumulative charges, compared to 387 [259,559] claims and $USD16,953 [$USD10,033,$USD26,604] cumulative charges. Change in total ARFS and ARFS subscales were predictors of 21-year cumulative healthcare claims. For each 1-point increase in ARFS over time, 1.2 fewer healthcare claims were made (95% CI 0.3-2.2). Increasing vegetable and dairy ARFS scores were correlated with significantly fewer claims. Baseline greater variety of vegetables was correlated with fewer 21-year healthcare claims and costs. Worsening diet quality over time was correlated with greater cumulative healthcare claims and costs. Consideration of dietary quality/variety in national policy is suggested to potentially reduce national healthcare claims/costs.","Erin D Clarke, Jennifer N Baldwin, Lee M Ashton, Tracy L Burrows, Alexis Hure, Deborah Loxton, Amanda J Patterson, Clare E Collins","Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","2024Sep23",NA
"39321662","Exploring the quality of urban green spaces and their association with health: An epidemiological study on obesity using Street View technology.","Evidence suggests that access to urban green spaces (UGS) may encourage physical exercise and impact nutritional status and health. Nevertheless, the quality of UGS is an understudied area. Novel digital tools allow the analysis of urban environments. This study aims to explore the quality of UGS and its association with obesity in Córdoba, Argentina, using Google Street View (GSV) images. Population-based cross-sectional study. Lifestyle and sociodemographic data were collected in Córdoba, Argentina (n = 1322 adults) during 2020-2022. Anthropometric measurements were obtained. Buffers of 500m were established around dwellings to identify the presence of large-area UGS (≥1ha). The quality of 226 UGS was evaluated across specific dimensions using a multi-dimensional assessment tool adapted for remote monitoring through GSV. Two-level logistic regression models for obesity outcome (yes/no) were fitted using a random intercept to account for spatial variability. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated as measures of association. Obesity was present in 25.9 % of participants. The UGS quality dimensions that showed an inverse association with obesity were safety (OR = 0.33; 95 % CI 0.32-0.82), potential usage (OR = 0.42; 95 % CI 0.21-0.81), surroundings (OR = 0.54; 95 % CI 0.31-0.93), access (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.31-0.97), aesthetics (OR = 0.55; 95 % CI 0.34-0.87) and amenities (OR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.42-0.91). Proximity to UGS was not significantly associated with obesity. Rather than their proximity, the quality of the UGS might play a key role as a determinant of obesity. In urban areas, digital tools such as GSV are useful to explore these topics.","Julia Mariel Wirtz Baker, Laura Rosana Aballay, Eugenia Haluszka, Camila Niclis, Stefano Staurini, Victoria Lambert, Sonia Alejandra Pou","Public health","2024Sep24",NA
"39321602","Classification of longitudinal estimated glomerular filtration rate trajectories in Canadian adults with type 1 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) development. The aims of this study were to classify trajectories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a cohort of Canadian adults with T1D, and to describe the risk factors associated with declining eGFR trajectories. In this retrospective cohort of adults with T1D, data was collected between 1996 and 2020. CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Latent class mixed models were used to categorize eGFR trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with declining eGFR trajectories. In this study, 304 adults were analyzed, with baseline measurements at a median duration of T1D of 15.3 (5.4-24.2) years. Eight percent of the cohort developed CKD over a median duration of 24.3 (13.7-34.8) years. Four classes of longitudinal eGFR trajectories were identified, broadly categorized as steeply declining (SD1, SD2) and gradual declining (GD1, GD2). Female sex, poor glycemic control, elevated body mass index, and albuminuria were associated with a steeply declining trajectory. In this cohort, four distinctive eGFR trajectories were identified, including a subtype with steeply declining eGFR. Given the complex nature of CKD progression, further prospective study of this model for identification of individuals at risk for CKD based on their trajectory of kidney function may support clinicians in their decision-making.","Kristen Favel, Jeffrey N Bone, Tom Elliott, Constadina Panagiotopoulos, Cherry Mammen","Journal of diabetes and its complications","2024Sep16",NA
"39321541","Risk factors for adverse events after clavicle fracture open reduction and internal fixation: A NSQIP study.","Midshaft clavicle fractures are often subject to increased complications when treated nonoperatively, so surgical treatment with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is a favored alternative. Despite safer outcomes, adverse events such as surgical site infections may still persist, particularly in the presence of certain patient characteristics. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for and the frequency of adverse events following ORIF for clavicle fractures. A retrospective review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2012 to 2021 identified patients undergoing isolated ORIF for clavicle fractures. Patient demographics and 30-day complications were collected. Bivariate analyses with a student's t-test or chi-square test were used to identify possible predictor variables for either AAE or SSI, and demographic metrics with P < 0.2 were included in a multivariable regression model. Multivariable analyses identified significant independent patient risk factors for any adverse event (AAE) or SSI within 30-days of surgery. Adjusted odds ratios were reported for each variable included in the model. Statistical significance was set a prior at P < 0.05. The 6,753 selected patients who underwent ORIF for clavicle fractures between 2012 and 2021 were 38.1 ± 15.3 years of age, BMI 26.2 ± 4.9 kg m-12, and 77.3 % male. Of this cohort, 88.4 % received treatment on an outpatient basis. Postoperative adverse events were experienced by 128 (1.9 %) patients within 30 days of surgery, and SSI were prevalent in 0.77 % of patients, followed by wound dehiscence in 0.12 % of patients. After controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities, notable risk factors for adverse events included current smoking status (OR=2.036; P < 0.001) and patient age (OR=1.025; P < 0.001). Outpatient status (OR=0.528; P = 0.004) was protective. The present study noted significantly increased risk of postoperative adverse events in older patients, as well as patients who smoke. Outpatient setting was significantly protective for adverse events. These findings help to provide further clinical context to guide surgical decision making and inform surgeons on current risks and outcomes.","Aadi Sharma, Isabel Shaffrey, Charles R Reiter, James R Satalich, Brady Ernst, Conor N O'Neill, Carl Edge, Jennifer L Vanderbeck","Injury","2024Sep18",NA

These charts-lab and non-lab versions-estimate a person's overall CVD risk; the non-lab version is intended for low-resource environments. Using the ""non-lab"" and ""lab"" versions of the WHO CVD risk prediction charts, we sought to estimate the burden of ten-year risk of a fatal or non-fatal CVD event in a tertiary care hospital of Puducherry and to assess the agreement between them. We included 255 doctors working in a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry. Age, gender, systolic blood pressure, and smoking status are all factors used in both charts. Moreover, a lab chart requires a person's total cholesterol and diabetes mellitus status, whereas a non-lab chart requires a person's body mass index. Proportions (95% confidence intervals) were used to portray the population at various CVD risk levels. Using Cohen's Kappa, the degree of agreement between the lab and non-lab charts was assessed (k). The majority of the study participants had <5% risk of CVD, and none had a risk of >20% in both the charts, which shows the better health-seeking behaviour of doctors. A good level of agreement was shown by the 95.2% (95%CI = 91.7 - 97.4 ) concordance in the risk categorization between the two charts (k = 0.934).

"39321166","Food craving, vitamin A, and menstrual disorders: A comprehensive study on university female students.","Menstrual disorders, influenced by dietary habits like high fat intake and low fruit and vegetable consumption, are a global public health issue. This study assessed the prevalence of dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and irregular menstrual cycle (IMC) among female university students in Bangladesh, focusing on food cravings and low vitamin A intake as risk factors. In this comprehensive study, data from randomly selected female university students were collected using a structured questionnaire. The associations were analyzed through chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression, reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR). The most prevalent menstrual disorder was dysmenorrhea (68.3%) followed by PMS (33.8%), and IMC (24.3%). Food cravers for high-fat and sweet foods were likely to experience dysmenorrhea (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5-3.9, P<0.001), suffer from PMS (AOR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3-6.6, P<0.001), and have IMC (AOR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6-5.3, P<0.001) vs. subjects who didn't. Subjects consuming vitamin A-rich plant foods had 40% (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9, P < 0.01) and 60% (AOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.6, P<0.001) less likely suffering from dysmenorrhea and IMC vs. who didn't. Both underweight and overweight/obese subjects experienced more than 2-fold dysmenorrhea vs. normal-weight peers. The chance of IMC was nearly 3-fold among overweight/obese subjects. However, lower physical activity was associated with PMS and IMC whereas family history was associated with dysmenorrhea and PMS. Among the socio-demographic factors, maternal education, place of residence, and earlier menarche (≤12 years) were associated with dysmenorrhea while marital status was associated with IMC. This study indicates that increasing the intake of vitamin A-rich plant foods and reducing high-fat, sweet foods can lower the risk of dysmenorrhea and IMC. Additionally, it highlights the need for regular exercise to mitigate the increased risk of PMS and IMC.","Liton Chandra Sen, Ishrat Jahan, Nadia Salekin, Jahid Hasan Shourove, Mosiur Rahman, Md Jamal Uddin, Cuilin Zhang, Davidson H Hamer, G M Rabiul Islam","PloS one","2024","Humans; Female; Students; Universities; Young Adult; Vitamin A; Adult; Dysmenorrhea; Adolescent; Craving; Menstruation Disturbances; Prevalence; Bangladesh; Surveys and Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Feeding Behavior; Premenstrual Syndrome"

A literature search identified studies reporting PROMs-knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) or visual analog scale (VAS) for pain-after repair of the medial meniscus. Studies were excluded if outcomes were not separated by tear type or reported graphically, different or no outcomes reported, no repair or repair with a sutureless method, follow-up greater than 72 months, case report, and systematic review. Patient-reported outcome measures and demographics were summarized as sample-weighted means and compared using t-tests. Mixed model linear regressions were fit predicting postoperative PROMs adjusted for tear type, preoperative PROMs, and follow-up time. F statistics of type III tests of fixed effects were compared. Eighteen articles were included, n = 10 received MMRT repair and n = 8 other tear repairs. Postoperative values for all KOOS scores were less for the MMRT repair group compared with the other tear repair group, VAS pain was not statistically different. Tear type was a stronger predictor for postoperative PROMs than the preoperative score and duration of follow-up for all KOOS scores, but not VAS pain. On average, the MMRT repair group had shorter follow-up, more women, older age, and greater BMI. All postoperative PROMs except for VAS pain were worse for patients who underwent MMRT repair compared with patients who underwent other types of medial meniscus repair. Tear type was a better predictor of postoperative PROMs despite intergroup differences in preoperative PROMs and duration of follow-up. Relative risk factors for MMRT compared with other types of medial meniscus tears include older age, greater BMI, and female sex.","Jared E Gurba, Nomi S Weiss-Laxer, Mohammad N Haider, John M Marzo","Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

In this study, we implemented a machine learning model to predict the response to prokinetics and/or neuromodulators in patients with GP-like symptoms. Subjects with suspected GP underwent simultaneous gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES) and wireless motility capsule and were followed for 6 months. Subjects were included if they were started on neuromodulators and/or prokinetics. Subjects were considered responders if their GP Cardinal Symptom Index at 6 months decreased by ≥1 from baseline. A machine learning model was trained using lasso regression, ridge regression, or random forest. Five-fold cross-validation was used to train the models, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was calculated using the test set. Of the 150 patients enrolled, 123 patients received either a prokinetic and/or a neuromodulator. Of the 123, 45 were considered responders and 78 were nonresponders. A ridge regression model with the variables, such as body mass index, infectious prodrome, delayed gastric emptying scintigraphy, no diabetes, had the highest AUC-ROC of 0.72. The model performed well for subjects on prokinetics without neuromodulators (AUC-ROC of 0.83) but poorly for those on neuromodulators without prokinetics. A separate model with gastric emptying time, duodenal motility index, no diabetes, and functional dyspepsia performed better (AUC-ROC of 0.75).

Prospective 1-year data from 53 premenopausal women with two proven normal-length (21-36 days) and normally ovulatory (≥10 days luteal) menstrual cycles upon enrollment showed that, despite 29% of all cycles having incident ovulatory disturbances, within-woman follicular phase length variances were significantly greater than luteal phase length variances. Many studies report menstrual cycle variability, yet few describe variability in follicular and luteal phase lengths. Luteal lengths are assumed 'fixed' at 13-14 days. Most studies have described follicular and luteal phase variability between-women. This study was a prospective, 1-year, observational cohort study of relative follicular and luteal phase variability both between and within community-dwelling women with two documented normal-length (21-36 days) and normally ovulatory (≥10 days luteal phase) menstrual cycles prior to enrollment. Eighty-one women enrolled in the study and 66 women completed the 1-year study. This study analyzed data from 53 women with complete data for ≥8 cycles (mean 13). Participants were healthy, non-smoking, of normal BMI, ages 21-41 with two documented normal-length (21-36 days) and normally ovulatory (≥10 days luteal phase) menstrual cycles prior to enrollment. Participants recorded first morning temperature, exercise durations, and menstrual cycle/life experiences daily in the Menstrual Cycle Diary. We analyzed 694 cycles utilizing a twice-validated least-squares Quantitative Basal Temperature method to determine follicular and luteal phase lengths. Statistical analysis compared relative follicular and luteal phase variance in ovulatory cycles both between-women and within-woman. Normal-length cycles with short luteal phases or anovulation were considered to have subclinical ovulatory disturbances (SOD). The 1-year overall 53-woman, 676 ovulatory cycle variances for menstrual cycle, follicular, and luteal phase lengths were 10.3, 11.2, and 4.3 days, respectively. Median variances within-woman for cycle, follicular, and luteal lengths were 3.1, 5.2, and 3.0 days, respectively. Menstrual cycles were largely of normal lengths (98%) with an important prevalence of SOD: 55% of women experienced >1 short luteal phase (<10 days) and 17% experienced at least one anovulatory cycle. Within-woman follicular phase length variances were greater than luteal phase length variances (P < 0.001). However, follicular (P = 0.008) and luteal phase length (P = 0.001) variances, without differences in cycle lengths, were greater in women experiencing any anovulatory cycles (n = 8) than in women with entirely normally ovulatory cycles (n = 6). Limitations of this study include the relatively small cohort, that most women were White, initially had a normal BMI, and the original cohort required two normal-length and normally ovulatory menstrual cycles before enrollment. Thus, this cohort's data underestimated population menstrual cycle phase variances and the prevalence of SOD. Our results reinforce previous findings that the follicular phase is more variable than the luteal phase in premenopausal women with normal-length and ovulatory menstrual cycles. However, our study adds to the growing body of evidence that the luteal phase is not predictably 13-14 days long.

"39320606","Evaluation of risk factors associated with the peritoneal flap hernioplasty for complex incisional hernia repair - a retrospective review of 327 cases.","Repair of large incisional hernias is challenging, and the risks of postoperative complications have been associated with obesity, smoking, and diabetes. The present study was conducted to determine the impact of these risk factors on short and long-term outcomes following the repair with the peritoneal flap hernioplasty (PFH). Three hundred twenty-seven patients undergoing PFH for incisional hernia repair were identified. Patient demographics and clinical data were recorded. Patients presenting signs of complications were assessed during a visit to the outpatient clinic. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between BMI, smoking and diabetes, and postoperative complications. The study included 157 males (48.0%) and 170 females (52.0%). Median BMI was 30.9 kg/m2. Diabetes was present in 13.8% of patients. 23.2% were active smokers. The recurrence rate was 2.4%. The odds ratios for postoperative complications were increased by 9% per BMI unit (P < 0.01), due predominantly to a rise in superficial wound infections (P < 0.01) and seroma production (P = 0.07). The adjusted odds ratio increased fourfold in patients with BMI > 40 kg/m2 (P = 0.06). Incisional hernia repair with the PFH technique is associated with a low risk of short and long-term complications. The risk is associated with obesity and significantly increased in patients with a BMI exceeding 40 kg/m2, where a fourfold increase was observed predominantly due to seroma and superficial wound infections. The recurrence rate was 2.4% and was unaltered across BMI categories. No association was established between smoking, diabetes, and the risk of all-cause complications.","Kristian Als Nielsen, Bruce Tulloh, Andrew de Beaux, Andreas Kristian Pedersen, Sofie Ronja Petersen, Brandur Jogvansson, Mark Bremholm Ellebaek, Alexandros Valsamidis, Ayat Allah Alnabhan, Per Helligsø, Michael Festersen Nielsen","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","2024Sep25",NA
"39320605","A single-centre, retrospective study of incisional hernia repair outcomes post kidney transplantation.","Incisional hernias (IH) after kidney transplantation (KTx) can cause significant morbidity in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). We aimed to report the outcomes of surgical repair of IH in KTR from our centre. We retrospectively analysed all the IH repairs in KTR from May 2018 to May 2023. We documented pre-transplant baseline characteristics, peri- and post-KTx events and outcomes and post-IH repair complications. We also documented length of stay, survival, and hernia recurrence post-IH repair. We performed 35 incisional hernia repairs in 34 KTR from May 2018 to May 2023 with an overall incidence of 1.63% symptomatic IH. Mean patient age was 56.7 ± 10.1 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 29.7 ± 6.49 kg/m2. A history of previous hernia operation and open abdominal operations was present in 11.4% and 22.9% of the population, respectively. The types of repairs performed were primary (5.7%), onlay (62.9%), inlay (2.9%) and retromuscular sublay (28.6%). Mean hernia neck size was 8.9 ± 5.6 cm. After IH repair, there was no perioperative mortality with an average 5.5 ± 3.9 days of length of stay. There were seven episodes (20%) of IH recurrence. There was a 6% of superficial wound dehiscence rate and a 3% of surgical site infection. Pearson's correlation test revealed that post-operative hernia recurrence was not related with neck size, post-transplant complications or pre- and post-transplant characteristics, as well as post-transplant outcome. The recurrence rate in our cohort was 20%. Known risk factors for IH in KTR as well as post-KTx events were not correlated with hernia recurrence or other post-hernia repair complications.","Nikolaos-Andreas Anastasopoulos, Shoaib Fahad Hussain, Paul E Herbert, Anand S R Muthusamy, Frank Jmf Dor, Vassilios Papalois","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","2024Sep25",NA

This cross-sectional study used retrospective data from 103 NFAI patients, 100 MACS (serum cortisol after a 1-mg dexamethasone test >50 nmol/L), and 59 with CS. Abdominal CT scans measured hepatic and splenic CT values to calculate the liver-to-spleen (L/S) ratio. Metabolic indicators including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), LDL-c, HDL-c, HbA1c, etc were measured. Mediation analysis was used to explore the indirect effects of metabolic traits on the cortisol-liver fat relationship. Patients included 103 NFAI, 100 MACS, and 59 CS. MACS patients had higher NAFLD prevalence (57%) than NFAI (26.2%, p < 0.001) but lower than CS (66.1%, p < 0.001). MACS and CS were associated with NAFLD (OR 3.83 and OR 5.73, p < 0.01), adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and covariates. Midnight serum cortisol correlated with L/S ratio (p < 0.001). HbA1c and Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) mediated 24.5% and 49.5% of the cortisol and L/S ratio association, respectively. FPG, HbA1c, HDL-c, and TyG mediated the association between MACS or CS and the L/S ratio. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fructosamine, and triglycerides mediated for MACS, while alkaline phosphatase did so for CS. Total cholesterol, LDL-c, ALT, AST, γ-GT, insulin, and uric acid did not mediate the association. MACS and CS are linked to significant metabolic disturbances, including increased liver fat and impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to fatty liver.","Peng Yu, Haoyue Yuan, Xiaomu Li, Hong Chen","Endocrine","2024Sep25",NA

We performed hierarchical cluster analysis to identify phenotypic profiles of these patients and their risks of residual thromboembolic events. We utilised data from non-valvular AF patients on OACs, as documented in phases II and III of the GLORIA-AF (Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Anti-thrombotic Treatment in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) registry. We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify distinct phenotypic profiles. We compared the incidence and risks of thromboembolic events (composite of ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or systemic embolism) and related outcomes (major bleeding and all-cause death) across the profiles. We determined the optimal number of profiles through visual inspection of the generated dendrograms. We included 22,410 patients (mean age 70 ± 8 years; 56% male), from which five phenotypes were identified: profile 1 (""uncontrolled hypertension""), profile 2 (""young with a history of coronary artery disease""), profile 3 (""young and obese""), profile 4 (""frailty""), and profile 5 (""non-paroxysmal AF with tachycardia""). Profile 4 was associated with the highest rates of thromboembolic events (1.66/100 person-years [95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.89]), major bleeding (1.92/100 person-years [1.70-2.16]), and death (6.02/100 person-years [5.62-6.43]). Profile 3 was associated with the lowest risk across all measured outcomes (thromboembolic events, 0.64 events/100 person-years [0.48-0.82]; major bleeding, 0.83 events/100 person-years [0.65-1.04]; and death, 1.44 events/100 person-years [1.21-1.71]). Profile 1 had a moderate thromboembolic event rate (1.04/100 person-years [0.91-1.08]), while profiles 2 and 5 showed lower rates. The phenotypic profiles of patients with AF prescribed OACs identified using hierarchical cluster analysis are associated with distinct residual thromboembolic risks and related outcomes. This approach has the potential to enhance patient risk-stratification and holistic approaches to management.","Hironori Ishiguchi, Azmil H Abdul-Rahim, Bi Huang, Steven Ho Man Lam, Yang Liu, Brian Olshansky, Tze-Fan Chao, Menno V Huisman, Gregory Y H Lip, NA NA","Journal of general internal medicine","2024Sep25",NA

This post hoc analysis assessed tofacitinib efficacy and safety in patients with PsA or AS by cigarette smoking status at trial screening. Pooled data from phase 3 and long-term extension (safety only) PsA trials and phase 2 and 3 AS trials were assessed by current/past versus never smoker status. Analysis included efficacy and safety data for tofacitinib 5 (PsA/AS) and 10 (PsA only) mg twice daily (BID) or placebo, and safety data in AS for tofacitinib 2 and 10 mg BID. Efficacy outcomes included American College of Rheumatology ≥ 50% responses (ACR50) and minimal disease activity (MDA) responses to month (M)6/M3 (tofacitinib/placebo) in PsA; and ≥ 40% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society responses (ASAS40) and AS Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) < 2.1 responses to week (W)16 in AS. Safety was assessed to M48/W48 (PsA/AS), adjusted for treatment/smoking status/median body mass index (BMI) status/sex/trial/treatment-smoking status interaction. PsA/AS cohorts included 342/178 current/past and 572/194 never smokers. Tofacitinib efficacy was generally greater versus placebo to M3/W6 (PsA/AS), and comparable in current/past and never smokers to M6/W16 (PsA/AS). In patients receiving ≥ 1 tofacitinib dose, adjusted treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE)/serious AE (SAE)/discontinuation due to AE incidence rates (IRs) to M48 in PsA were higher in current/past versus never smokers; adjusted IRs to W48 in AS were higher in current/past versus never smokers for TEAEs, but similar for SAEs/discontinuation due to AEs. In both patients with PsA and AS, tofacitinib efficacy was greater versus placebo, and comparable across smoking categories. Adjusted IRs were higher in current/past versus never smokers for TEAEs, SAEs, discontinuation due to AEs in PsA, and for TEAEs in AS, complementing reports of associations between smoking and comorbidities in spondyloarthritis.

To examine the prevalence of knee pain in 13-year-old children and assess associations of knee pain with physical factors and the presence of structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Data from the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort, were used. Prevalence and characteristics of knee pain were assessed, using a pain mannequin, in children 13 years of age (N = 1849). Patient characteristics and data on physical activity were extracted from questionnaires. The body mass index standard deviation score and waist-hip ratio were calculated from objectively measured weight and height. Structural abnormalities were assessed by MRI. The differences between children with and without knee pain were also analyzed. A prevalence of 8.0% was found for knee pain in children, of which 92.3% persisted for >3 months (ie, chronic); 37.5% of the children experienced pain daily, and the pain was almost always located on the anterior side of the knee (98.6%). Higher body mass index standard deviation scores were seen in children with knee pain than in the children without knee pain. No differences in physical activity were seen between children with and without knee pain. Moreover, in children with knee pain compared with children without knee pain, characteristics of Osgood-Schlatter disease (6.8% vs 1.9%) and bipartite patella type 3 (4.7% vs 0.3%) were more often seen on MRI. This study shows that knee pain is a relatively frequent problem in children. It is almost always located on the anterior aspect, has a chronic character, and is often experienced daily. However, the possible implication of structural abnormalities on MRI in children with knee pain and the possible relationship with the development of future knee complaints are still unclear.","Guido J van Leeuwen, Laura A M Kemmeren, Tom M Piscaer, Edwin H G Oei, Patrick J E Bindels, Sita M A Bierma-Zeinstra, Marienke van Middelkoop","The American journal of sports medicine","2024Sep25",NA

Two hundred-fifty patients with fractures in the proximal femur underwent treatment using Gamma3 nails integrated with U-blade lag screws from 2015 to 2022. Among these cases, 33 had combined neck and trochanteric fractures; 8 patients were excluded because of follow-up for <1 year. The remaining data of 25 patients (7 males and 18 females) were reviewed. Bone mineral density (BMD), body mass index (BMI), tip-apex distance (TAD), extent of lag screw migration, femoral neck-shaft angle, callus formation, fracture type, and treatment failure were analyzed. The mean patient age was 76.3 (range, 61-91) years, and the mean follow-up duration was 17.3 (range, 12.5-57.3) months. The mean BMD T-scores for the spine and femoral neck were -2.3 ± 1.0 and -2.8 ± 0.7, respectively; 18 patients had T-scores ≤-2.5, indicating osteoporosis. The mean BMI was 23.2 ± 3.8 kg/m2 , and the mean operative time was 69.8 (range, 45-90) minutes. Twenty-one patients experienced injuries from slipping, 2 sustained injuries from falling, and 2 from car traffic accidents. The mean TAD was 21.6 ± 5.9 mm, with 16 patients showing <25 mm. The mean extent of lag screw migration was 5.7 ± 5.1 mm. The mean femoral neck-shaft angle on plain radiographs was 125.1 ± 8.6 degrees immediately postoperatively and 120.3 ± 9.5 degrees at the final follow-up. During the follow-up period, the first callus formation was observed at 3.8 months (range, 1.4-7.3) on plain radiographs in the anteroposterior and axial views. Based on our fracture criteria, 4 patients had a two-part fracture type, 12 patients had three-part, and 9 patients had four-part. Out of 25 patients, 3 exhibited treatment failure. No significant differences were observed between the groups with and without bone union regarding age, BMD, BMI, operative time, TAD of the lag screw, extent of lag screw migration, and femoral neck-shaft angle.

The utilization of anthropometric measures in the diagnosis and management of PCOS has gained increasing attention due to their practicality and predictive capacity for associated conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance. This review rigorously explores the application of various anthropometric indices, including body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and advanced metrics such as the body shape index and body roundness index, wrist circumference, neck circumference. These indices offer critical insights into body fat distribution and its association with the metabolic and hormonal perturbations characteristic of PCOS. The review underscores the necessity of addressing obesity, a prevalent comorbidity in PCOS, through lifestyle modifications and personalized therapeutic approaches. By incorporating anthropometric evaluations into routine clinical practice, healthcare professionals can enhance diagnostic precision, optimize treatment strategies, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This integrative approach not only facilitates the management of the metabolic challenges inherent in PCOS but also contributes to the development of more individualized therapeutic interventions, thereby enhancing the overall quality of life for women affected by PCOS.","Suparna Parua, Arnab Das, Anukona Hazra, Prasenjit Chaudhuri, Koushik Bhattacharya, Sulagna Dutta, Pallav Sengupta","Clinical physiology and functional imaging","2024Sep25",NA

We conducted a retrospective study of 99 patients (110 hips) from March 2006 to May 2017 who underwent MoM HRA. The Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score were measured, and the patients underwent clinical and radiological management. Serum levels of cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), and molybdenum (Mo) were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) at 1, 6, and 12 months, and each year follow-up after prosthesis implantation. Patients were followed up from 1 to 156 months, with a mean of 98 months. No complications occurred. Metal ion analysis revealed significantly elevated levels compared to preoperative levels. The metal ions levels increased and reached a peak after surgery, and then the levels began to decline gradually. Approximately 84-108 months after surgery, the metal ion levels increased again to approximately peak levels. Then, up to 156 months after surgery, the metal ions levels will drop approximately to preoperative levels. The serum levels of Cr in women were higher than those in men, with the difference being statistically significant. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥24.9 kg/m2 Co levels were significantly higher than those of normal-weight patients. The serum levels of metal ions showed no significant differences between the prostheses. The use of the MoM HRA was clinically effective, and the Co, Cr, and Mo levels increased significantly after HRA; however, upon long-term follow-up, serum metal ion levels tended to decrease to preoperative levels.

Malnutrition excess was defined by clustering two indicators: body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference; weight deficit was defined by clustering BMI and arm and calf circumferences. The chi-square test was used to associate malnutrition with sociodemographic variables, dietary and health conditions, and to determine the heterogeneity of malnutrition, a latent class analysis was performed. Overweight was 31.9%, whereas underweight, according to BMI and calf circumference, was 7.9%, and increased to 18.8% when arm circumference was also taken into account. Five latent classes of malnutrition were generated - class 1: no overweight and deteriorated health conditions; class 2: no weight deficit and deteriorated health conditions; class 3: no malnutrition and deteriorated health conditions; class 4: overweight and multimorbidity; and class 5: low protein food intake without being underweight or overweight.

Longitudinal analysis of a prospective national database including 5,308 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and an indication of continuous positive airway pressure. Near-misses related to sleepiness, accidents related to sleepiness, and sleepiness at the wheel were assessed before initiation and after ≥ 90 days of treatment. Multivariable associations with the cumulative incidence of near-misses and accidents under treatment were calculated using Cox models adjusted for age, sex, obesity, sleep duration, sleepiness at the wheel, accidents/near-misses history, depressive symptoms, residual apnea-hypopnea index, and adherence to treatment. Residual sleepiness at the wheel under treatment was associated with eight-fold higher incidence of near-misses related to sleepiness (HR=8.63 [6.08-12.2]) and five-fold higher incidence of accidents related to sleepiness (HR=5.24 [2.81-9.78]). Adherence ≤4h/night was also a significant predictor of persistent driving risk (HR=1.74 [1.12-2.71] for near-misses and HR=3.20 [1.37-7.49] for accidents). Residual sleepiness at the wheel and treatment-adherence ≤4h/night are easy-to assess markers to detect persistent driving risk during the follow-up evaluations of patients under treatment.

Four machine learning algorithms were employed to identify the factors most predictive of IHCA. The support vector machine model was discovered to be the most effective at predicting IHCA. The ten most critical physiological parameters at 8 h prior to the event were pulse rate, age, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, body temperature, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, platelet count, and use of central nervous system-active medication. Using these parameters, we can enhance early warning and rapid response systems in our hospital, potentially reducing the incidence of IHCA in clinical practice.","Wei-Tsung Wu, Chew-Teng Kor, Ming-Chung Chou, Hui-Min Hsieh, Wan-Chih Huang, Wei-Ling Huang, Shu-Yen Lin, Ming-Ru Chen, Tsung-Hsien Lin","The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences","2024Sep25",NA
"39319349","Evaluating Lung Changes in Long COVID: Ultra-Low-Dose vs. Standard-Dose CT Chest.","Frequent chest CTs within a short period during follow-up of long COVID patients may increase the risk of radiation-related health effects in the exposed individuals. We aimed to assess the image quality and diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) chest compared to standard-dose CT (SDCT) in detecting lung abnormalities associated with long COVID. In this prospective study, 100 long COVID patients with respiratory dysfunction underwent SDCT and ULDCT chest that were compared in terms of objective (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) and subjective image quality (image graininess, sharpness, artifacts, and diagnostic accuracy along with the European guidelines on image quality criteria for CT chest), detection of imaging patterns of long COVID, CT severity score, and effective radiation dose. Additionally, the diagnostic performance of ULDCT was compared among obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI<30 kg/m2) subjects. The mean age of study participants was 53 ± 12.9 years, and 68% were male. The mean SNR was 31.4 ± 5.5 and 11.3 ± 4.6 for SDCT and ULDCT respectively (p< 0.0001). Common findings seen on SDCT included ground-glass opacities (GGOs, 77%), septal thickening/reticulations (67%), atelectatic/parenchymal bands (63%) and nodules (26%). ULDCT provided sharp images, with no/minimal graininess, and high diagnostic confidence in 81%, 82% and 80% of the cases respectively. The sensitivity of ULDCT for various patterns of long COVID was 72.7% (GGOs), 71.6% (interlobular septal thickening/reticulations), 100% (consolidation), 81% (atelectatic/parenchymal bands) and 76.9% (nodules). ULDCT scans in non-obese subjects exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity (88% vs. 60.3%, p < 0.0001) and diagnostic accuracy (97.7% vs. 84.9%, p < 0.0001) compared to obese subjects. ULDCT showed very strong correlation with SDCT in terms of CT severity score (r = 0.996, p < 0.0001). The mean effective radiation dose with ULDCT was 0.25 ± 0.02 mSv with net radiation dose reduction of 94.8% ± 1.7% (p < 0.0001) when compared to SDCT (5.5 ± 1.96 mSv). ULDCT scans achieved comparable diagnostic accuracy to SDCT for detecting long COVID lung abnormalities in non-obese patients, while significantly reducing radiation exposure.","Shritik Devkota, Mandeep Garg, Uma Debi, Sahajal Dhooria, Ashish Dua, Nidhi Prabhakar, Saumya Soni, Muniraju Maralakunte, Ajay Gulati, Tarvinder Singh, Manavjit Singh Sandhu","British journal of biomedical science","2024","Humans; COVID-19; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Lung; Radiation Dosage; Adult; Prospective Studies; Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Signal-To-Noise Ratio"
"39319305","Comparison of Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome and Five Obesity- and Lipid-Linked Indicators for Predicting Metabolic Syndrome Among Normal-Weight and Overweight Adults.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an increasingly prevalent issue in China's public health landscape. Few studies have investigated the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in overweight people. We proposed to analyze and contrast the occurrence of MetS in normal-weight and overweight individuals and identify potential indicators for forecasting MetS in adults in Zhejiang Province. This cohort study included 359 adults aged 40-65 years and followed up for five years in Zhejiang Province. The study assessed the predictive capabilities of five indicators linked to obesity and lipid levels, namely body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), triglyceride-glucose index (TyGi), and their combined indices (TyG-BMI, TyG-WHtR). The evaluation was done employing the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). DeLong test was applied to compare area under different ROC curves.We evaluated the relationships between five variables and MetS using multivariate logistic regression. In normal-weight individuals, the five-year cumulative incidence of MetS was 21.85%, but in overweight people, it was 60.33%. After adjusting for confounding factors, BMI, WHtR, TyGi, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR were independently linked to MetS in normal-weight individuals, while BMI, TyGi, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR were independently linked to MetS in overweight individuals. In normal-weight individuals, the WHtR (AUC=0.738 and optimal threshold value =0.469) and TyG-WHtR (AUC=0.731 and optimal threshold value =4.121) had the larger AUC, which was significantly greater than that of the different three indicators. The TyG-BMI (AUC=0.769 and optimal threshold value = 211.099) was the best predictor of MetS in overweight individuals. The five-year cumulative incidence of MetS in overweight people was approximately triple that of normal-weight people in Zhejiang Province. In the overweight population, the TyG-BMI performed better than the other indices in predicting MetS. WHtR and TyG-WHtR outperformed BMI, TyGi, and TyG-BMI in anticipating MetS in a normal-weight population.","Jiahua Wu, Xihua Lin, Xueyao Yin, Zhiye Xu, Nan Wu, Ziyi Zhang, Jiaqiang Zhou, Hong Li","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy","2024",NA

We utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) spanning from 2007 to 2018. WWI was calculated using the square root of waist circumference (cm) divided by body weight (kg). The frailty index ≥ 0.25 was employed to assess frailty. Weighted multivariate logistic regression was conducted to explore the association between WWI and frailty. Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) was used to explore potential non-linear relationships. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to assess the predictive ability of WWI for frailty. The study encompassed 7765 participants. Higher WWI was significantly associated with higher odds of frailty. In the fully adjusted model, each unit increase of WWI was associated with an 82% increased odds of frailty (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.61 - 2.06; P < 0.001). GAM found significant nonlinear relationships and threshold effects. The study presented a robust correlation between elevated WWI and increased odds of frailty among American older adults.

Few studies have investigated the prevalence and progression of CKD using different filtration markers for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A prospective observational cohort study. 6,393 White and African American participants aged 65-100 years from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) at Visit 5, followed longitudinally at Visits 6 and 7. The eGFR was estimated either by creatinine (eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys), or using creatinine, cystatin C, and β-2-microglobulin (eGFRcr-cys-b2m). CKD progression was defined as 30% decline in eGFR at follow-up visits. Logistic regression models, adjusted for sex, race and study center, diabetes, blood pressure, body mass index, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and heart failure. At Visit 5, the mean age in the study population was 75.8 years, and the mean eGFR ranged from 71.2 to 61.2 mL/min/1.73m2 using eGFRcr or eGFRcys, respectively. The proportion with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 was lowest with eGFRcr and highest with eGFRcys for all age groups, and prevalence increased with age for all markers. For example, the prevalence of eGFRcr < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 in ages 70-74 years ranged from 15% to 21% and in ages 85-89 years ranged from 38% to 46% at the different visits. The proportion with a 30% eGFR decline over a mean of 8 years in people who were originally aged 65-69 years ranged from 9% (eGFRcr)-18% (eGFRcys). More people with eGFRcr ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were reclassified to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 when using eGFRcys (33%) compared with eGFRcr-cys (12%) or eGFRcr-cys-b2m (18%). The proportion with 30% eGFR decline was lowest with eGFRcr and highest with eGFRcys, with greater incidence in older age groups for all markers. No direct measurement of GFR. Not all participants survived or attended subsequent follow-up visits. The prevalence and progression of CKD increase with age, but estimates vary with the filtration marker used. The eGFRcr gave the lowest estimate of CKD at 15% for people aged 65-69 years at Visit 5 while eGFRcys gave the highest estimates of CKD at 26% for that same population.","Carina M Flaherty, Aditya Surapaneni, Jesse C Seegmiller, Josef Coresh, Morgan E Grams, Shoshana H Ballew","Kidney medicine","2024Oct",NA
"39319151","Sex and obesity influence the relationship between perfluoroalkyl substances and lean body mass: NHANES 2011-2018.","Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are known endocrine disruptors, that have been the subject of limited research regarding their impact on human lean body mass. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PFAS exposure on lean body mass. We performed a cross-sectional data analysis involving 1022 adolescents and 3274 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018, whose lean body mass was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The lean mass index (LMI) was calculated as lean body mass dividing by the square of height. The association between PFAS and LMI was examined through a multivariate-adjusted weighted generalized linear model. Moreover, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models were employed to futher examine the relationship between the mixture of PFAS and LMI. Regression analyses revealed an inverse correlation between PFAS exposure and LMI after adjusting for potential covariates. Adults with higher serum PFAS concentrations manifested a reduction in whole LMI ( β  = -0.193, 95 % confidence interval (CI): -0.325 to -0.06). Notably, this correlation was particularly significant in adult females and individuals with obesity, and it was observed across diverse anatomical regions, including lower limbs, right arm, trunk, and whole lean body mass. In adult females, the association between PFAS and whole LMI was statistically significant ( β  = -0.294, 95 % CI: -0.495 to -0.094), and a similar trend was found in obese individuals ( β  = -0.512, 95 % CI: -0.762 to -0.261). WQS regression analyses supported the results obtained from weighted linear regression analyses. Our study suggests that exposure to PFAS, whether individually or in combination, is associated with decreased lean body mass in specific body areas, with sex and obesity serving as major influencing factors.","Xue Jia, Wenhui Liu, Xiaomeng Ling, Juan Li, Jing Ji, Baozhen Wang, Min Zhao","Heliyon","2024Sep15",NA

However, its association with COPD is poorly documented. Patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for clinical indications were recruited retrospectively and screened for LHIS and COPD. LHIS density and the coronary artery disease profile were quantified by CTA: stenosis severity (coronary artery disease radiological reporting system (CADRADS)), coronary artery calcium (CAC) and high-risk plaque (HRP). COPD patients with LHIS were matched for age and sex, the major cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and compared to controls. The prevalence of LHIS in all 5466 patients was 5.9%. 151 (72.6%) of 208 patients with COPD had LHIS. LHIS density in COPD patients was higher (-10.93 HU versus -21.1 HU; p<0.001), despite body mass index (BMI) (28.8 versus 27.01 kg·m-2; p=0.002) being lower. LHIS density was lower in obese (BMI >30 kg·m-2) patients (20.4 versus 13.6 HU; p=0.02). BMI was inversely correlated with LHIS density (BetaR -0.031; 95% CI: -0.054- -0.008; p=0.007). LHIS density was associated with COPD, but not with BMI on multivariate models. CAC and coronary stenosis severity (CADRADS and >50% stenosis) were not different (p=0.106, p=0.156 and p=0.350, respectively). HRPs were observed more frequently in COPD patients with severe Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages ≥2 (32.3% versus 20.1%; p=0.044), but not when adding mild GOLD stages. The prevalence of LHIS in COPD patients is high (72.6%), and the adipose tissue density is higher, indicating a higher brown fat component. In obese, patients LHIS density is lower and declines along with BMI.

However, data on the association between visceral obesity and the risk of CHF remain limited. We explored the relationship between CHF and cardiometabolic index (CMI). Drawing from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2011-2018, we enrolled 9,008 participants in a cross-sectional study. We calculated the CMI as triglyceride (TG)/high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C) × weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), and CMI-age as CMI × age. Then, we analyzed CMI and CMI-age as categorical and continuous variables to assess its correlation with CHF. To assess the relationships of CMI and CMI-age with CHF, we used multiple logistic regression models and performed subgroup analysis. To examine the predictive ability of CMI and CMI-age on patients with CHF, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The overall prevalence of CHF was 3.31%. The results revealed significant differences in demographic data, comorbidities, lifestyle variables, standing height, BMI, WC, WHtR, TG, and HDL-C among the four groups classified by CMI quartile and CMI-age quartile. When indicators were analyzed as continuous variables, CMI and CMI-age showed positive correlations with CHF in both the crude and adjusted models (all P < 0.05). When indicators were analyzed as categorical variables, it was found that in all four models, the ORs of group Q4 was significantly different compared to Q1 (all P < 0.05), suggesting the risk of CHF is significantly increased with higher CMI, and CMI-age. The associations of CMI and CMI-age with CHF were similar in all stratified populations (P for interaction > 0.05). The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of CMI and CMI-age in predicting CHF were 0.610 (95% CI, 0.578-0.642) and 0.697 (95% CI, 0.668-0.725) separately, suggesting that CMI-age was significantly better than the CMI in predicting CHF (P < 0.001). Both CMI and CMI-age were independently correlated with the risk for CHF. These results suggested that the CMI-age, which provides new insights into the prevention and management of CHF.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have the potential to reduce these risk factors, but their role in lymphedema has never been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine if GLP-RAs can reduce the risk of lymphedema in patients undergoing ALND. All patients who underwent ALND at a tertiary cancer center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed. Patients with less than 2 years of follow-up from the time of ALND were excluded. Race, BMI, radiation, chemotherapy history, pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes, lymphedema development after ALND, and the use of GLP-1RAs were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if there was a significant reduction in the risk of developing lymphedema after ALND. A sub-group analysis of non-diabetic patients was also performed. 3,830 patients who underwent ALND were included, 76 of which were treated with. GLP-1 RAs. The incidence of lymphedema in the GLP-1 RA cohort was 6.6% (5 patients). Compared to 28.5% (1,071 patients) in the non-GLP-1 RA cohort. On multivariate regression analysis, patients who were treated with GLP-1 RA were 86% less likely to develop lymphedema compared to the non-GLP-1 RA cohort (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04-0.32, p < 0.0001). A BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or greater was a statistically significant risk factor for developing lymphedema with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI 1.16-1.56, p < 0.0001). Diabetes was associated with lymphedema development that closely approached statistical significance (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.97-1.78, p = 0.06). A subgroup analysis solely on non-diabetic patients showed similar results. The odds of developing lymphedema were 84% lower for patients without diabetes treated with GLP1-RAs compared to those who did not receive GLP-1 RAs (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.40, p < 0.0001). GLP1-RAs appear to significantly reduce the risk of lymphedema in patientsundergoing ALND. The mechanism of action may be multifactorial and not limited to weight reduction and insulin resistance.

This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the first phase of SHCS during 2015-2017. The study included 1000 Iranian adults aged 35-70 years. The Gold standard for diabetes was determined by measuring fasting blood sugar (FBS) and evaluating the history of treatment and use of diabetes medications. To assess self-report validity, various statistical indices such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (NPVs), accuracy, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-) and AUC were used. The agreement between self-reported diabetes and the gold standard was assessed using kappa statistics. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13 and R 4.3.1 software. The study findings indicated that the prevalence of diabetes was 18% according to self-report and 19.9% according to the gold standard measurement. The self-report accuracy was 95.67%.

"39318556","Distribution of Normative Percentiles of Liver Stiffness Measurement Using Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography in an Adult Asian Indian Population.","Objective  The aim of this study was to determine the normative percentiles for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using shear wave elastography in an adult Asian Indian population as part of the preventive radiology initiative of the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association (IRIA). Methods  LSMs were ascertained by two-dimensional (2D) shear wave elastography using the Mindray Resona series of ultrasound machines. The image quality was assessed using the motion stability index (M-STB) and reliability (RLB) map. Ten acquisitions were documented, and an interquartile range-to-median (IQR/M) ratio ≤30% kilopascal (kPa) units was considered a good-quality measurement. A subgroup of the study population without comorbidities was chosen to derive the normative percentile distribution of LSM using a generalized least squares multivariable fractional polynomial regression model that adjusted for sex and body mass index (BMI). The effectiveness of the estimated percentiles was assessed on the entire study population using the greater than 90th percentile value of the LSM as the cutoff for abnormality. Results  The study included 852 people who underwent shear wave elastography from June 2022 to July 2023. The magnitude of compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) and clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) was 6.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.30-8.7) and 4.91% (95% CI: 3.67-6.60), respectively. The normative percentiles were estimated from 282 persons without associated comorbidity and risk factors. The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of the normal individuals was 40.90 ± 12.92 years, and 210 (71.47%) were males. The mean age (SD) of the 570 persons excluded from the normative percentiles analysis was 47.94 (12.49) years and 72.11% were males. The sex- and BMI-adjusted age-specific 90th percentiles of LSM were 8.76, 8.78, 8.96, 8.97, 9.25, and 9.45 kPa for 18 to 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50, 51 to 60, and 61 to 70 years, respectively. Conclusion  The sex- and BMI-adjusted age-specific 90th percentiles for LSM using shear wave elastography in Asian Indian adults are almost similar to the greater than 9 kPa cutoff proposed by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Liver Elastography Consensus Statement guidelines to discriminate cACLD and CSPH from normal individuals.","Rijo M Choorakuttil, Rajas N Chaubal, Thara Pratap, Amarnath Chelladurai, Praveen K Nirmalan","The Indian journal of radiology & imaging","2024Oct",NA
"39318279","Torque Teno Virus Loads as a Marker of Immunosuppression in Pediatric Kidney Transplant Recipients.","Long-term renal function and survival after kidney transplantation rely on appropriate immunosuppressive treatment to prevent the risk of rejection. New biomarkers are needed to accurately assess the degree of immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients in order to avoid organ rejection and the development of opportunistic infections. Highly prevalent in humans, torque teno virus (TTV), which belongs to the family Anelloviridae, is a small, nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus which has not been linked with any specific human illness, but which constitutes a major component of the human virome. Host antiviral responses allow TTV levels to be controlled; however, viral persistence remains, explaining the high prevalence in human populations, including healthy individuals. Important confounders of TTV load include time since transplantation, age, gender, obesity, and smoking status. TTV-based guidance of immunosuppressive drug dosing could help with risk stratification, reducing the risk of infection, graft rejection and oncologic disease on an individual level, enabling long-term patient and graft survival. Original studies were accessed by a systematic search from electronic databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect and Wiley Online Library. The presented data mainly derive from adult transplant recipients showing an association between TTV plasma levels and the immune status of the host: High-TTV load and high immunosuppression are associated with a risk of infection, and low-TTV load and low immunosuppression indicate a risk of rejection. However, there is minimal information on pediatric transplant recipients with further research required in this cohort. To date, it has been demonstrated that longer posttransplant times are significantly associated with lower TTV levels in children with renal transplant. Meanwhile, an association between lower TTV loads and increased risk of graft reject during the first year of transplantation was also reported. More recently, Eibensteiner et al. revealed a robust, independent association between TTV plasma load and the onset of Cytomegalovirus and BK virus infections. Data from randomized controlled trials are still missing, even in adults, but a multicenter randomized controlled trial for TTV-guided immunosuppression in adult kidney recipients (TTVguideIT) began in 2022. There is, therefore, great promise for TTV levels to be used as a biomarker that could potentially improve both graft and patient survival in transplantation.","Ellen Kelly, Atif Awan, Clodagh Sweeney, Dermot Wildes, Cillian De Gascun, Jaythoon Hassan, Michael Riordan","Pediatric transplantation","2024Nov","Humans; Torque teno virus; Kidney Transplantation; Child; Viral Load; DNA Virus Infections; Biomarkers; Immunosuppressive Agents; Immunosuppression Therapy; Graft Rejection; Transplant Recipients"
"39318201","Behavioural Problems in Preadolescence: Does Nutritional Status Have a Role?","Malnutrition in children and adolescents is a global issue particularly in low- and middle-income countries, while behavioural problems are becoming a growing public health concern in the area of child and adolescent mental health, with very few studies examining their association in preadolescence. This study aimed to assess the epidemiological relationship between malnutrition and behavioural problems in preadolescence. A school based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Total 660, 11- to 12-year-old preadolescents were selected from a middle-class, coeducational school chain. Sociodemographic questionnaires and an officially adapted version of Youth Self-Report Form (YSR), which is the child and adolescent reported version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), were used to collect data, along with anthropometric assessments following the WHO protocol. Thin and stunted preadolescents had significantly higher odds of internalizing problems (AOR = 2.05, p = 0.003 and AOR = 2.09, p = 0.039, respectively) than normal ones. Overnutrition was not associated with any behavioural issues. According to the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure, 40% of preadolescents had at least one type of malnutrition and among them about 3% had co-occurring malnutrition (stunted and thin or overweight). They significantly had higher risk of being associated with the internalizing problems (AOR 2.92, p = 0.027). The effect was considerably higher than that associated with stunted or thin only, highlighting the cumulative impact of the co-occurring malnutrition on the internalizing problems. Our study concludes that overnutrition and undernutrition are prevalent in preadolescents, with significant association of undernutrition with internalizing problems. Moreover, our study is the first that reports that the co-occurrence of malnutrition is significantly associated with increased risk of internalizing problems. This study highlights the importance of the link between physical and mental health and emphasizes the need for holistic interventions and programmes for addressing preadolescents' issues.","Bushra Khan, Waqas Hameed, Bilal Iqbal Avan","Child: care, health and development","2024Nov","Humans; Child; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutritional Status; Child Behavior Disorders; Pakistan; Malnutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors"
"39318198","Effects and individual response of salt substitute intervention on blood pressure in a high-risk stroke population: findings from 4200 participants of the China Salt Substitute and Stroke Study.","Background: The protective effects of salt substitutes on blood pressure are well established, yet the individual variations in response to salt substitutes remain unclear. Our study aims to identify the individuals who derive the greatest benefit from salt substitute interventions. Methods: Our study involved 4200 participants at high-risk of stroke from 120 villages in Liaoning Province, as a sub-study of the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS) trial, with 60 villages receiving a 5-year salt substitute intervention and other 60 villages using regular salt. The baseline and endpoint data on basic demographics, anthropometric measurements, and blood pressures were collected. General linear regressions were applied to assess the hypotensive effect of salt substitute intervention on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with adjustments for potential confounders using both regression adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Individual treatment effects (ITEs) of the salt substitute were estimated using causal forest and causal tree methods, and a treatment-by-subgroup interaction analysis was conducted to validate the robustness of our findings. Findings: During the 5-year follow-up, the salt substitute group exhibited a significant SBP reduction compared to the regular salt intervention group (β = -1.86 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.56 to -0.15 mmHg). This reduction remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders (β = -2.82 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.26 to -1.37 mmHg) and the usage status of antihypertensive medications (β = -2.60 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.95 to -1.15 mmHg). However, no significant reduction was observed in DBP levels. Moreover, baseline SBP, body mass index (BMI) and age were identified as the top three modifiers of the salt substitute intervention's efficacy on SBP levels. Specifically, individuals with a baseline SBP ≤ 142 mmHg and age ≤ 65 years old (ITE = -3.02 mmHg, 95% CI = -5.97 to -0.07 mmHg) or those with a baseline SBP >142 mmHg and BMI ≤ 28.2 kg m-2 (ITE = -4.36 mmHg, 95% CI = -6.58 to -2.14 mmHg) received greater benefits from salt substitute supplementations in reducing SBP levels, and the treatment-by-subgroup interaction analysis further corroborated these findings (Psalt intervention group×age = 0.03 and Psalt intervention group×BMI = 0.01). Conclusions: Salt substitutes may effectively lower blood pressure in individuals at high-risk of stroke, with the hypotensive effect varying according to individual characteristics. Notably, middle-aged individuals with normotension and non-obese patients with hypertension appear to derive the greatest benefit from salt substitute consumption.","Bing Ma, Jing Zhang, Ying Zhou, Xinying Song, Xilei Li, Yuyi Peng, Xin Wang, Hao Sun, Bo Zhou","Food & function","2024Sep25",NA

Prospective randomized controlled single- blind trial. A total of 79 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-obstructive sleep apnoea overlap syndrome were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 40) or control group (n = 39). All patients consistently adhered to positive airway pressure therapy every night from enrolment in the study, while intervention group patients received additional moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 20 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included the 6-Minute Walk Test, Barthel Index, body mass index, fat mass, free fat mass, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1%predicted, modified Medical Research Council, and polysomnography parameters. After 20 weeks, the intervention group exhibited statistically significant improvements in 6MWD, Barthel Index, body mass index, fat mass, and modified Medical Research Council compared with control group (all p < 0.01). In addition, the intervention group showed a significantly lower percentage of total sleep time with oxygen saturation < 90% (p = 0.013) and higher lowest nocturnal oxygen saturation (p = 0.008) than the control group. However, there was no significant difference in FEV1 %predicted between the 2 groups.

This study aims to explore the biological mechanisms of embodiment linking stress and health to understand physiological changes in the body's response to psychological stress in a Nigerian population. Through a multidisciplinary approach, this study queries the relationship between stress, cortisol, and salivary C-reactive protein (sCRP), a biomarker of inflammation, while also validating the use of sCRP as a potential and accurate stress indicator in the field. In this cross-sectional study, 138 passive drool saliva samples (nfemale = 89 nmale = 49) were collected and assessed for sCRP and cortisol levels in adults. Participants also completed a short demographic survey and, to measure psychological stress, the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Relationships between sCRP and stress-related variables (i.e., cortisol, GHQ-12, and demographic data) were assessed using Spearman's correlations, simple regression, multivariable linear regression, and exploratory factor analysis. sCRP levels ranged from 20.57 to 6879.41 pg/mL across all samples, with significant differences between female and male participants. The GHQ-12 was not a significant predictor of sCRP variability. However, socio-demographic factors such as body mass index (BMI), age, self-reported sex, ethnic identity, and cortisol were significant predictors, collectively explaining 24%-27% of the variation in sCRP. Socio-demographic predictors like BMI, age, sex, and particularly ethnic group experience in Nigeria encapsulate aspects of embodied stress, that significantly affect sCRP variability.","Taiye Winful, Modupe Sorunke, Jada Benn Torres","American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council","2024Sep24",NA

Yet, previous findings are mixed. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of LTPA and OPA, respectively, on dementia among men and women. In this observational, longitudinal study, we used data from the second wave of a population-based cohort from the municipality of Copenhagen as baseline. Data were collected in 1981-1983, and 10 343 participants were followed until the end of 2016. LTPA and OPA were self-reported, and information on dementia diagnoses and redemption of dementia medication was obtained at an individual level from national health registers. We used Poisson regression to analyze the association between LTPA/OPA and dementia and adjusted for self-reported age, socioeconomic factors, stress, and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, alcohol, body mass index, and blood pressure). A higher level of LTPA was associated with a lower dementia risk among men, but we found no clear association among women. OPA and dementia were not associated among men, but occupationally active women who reported OPA in terms of walking, lifting, and heavy work had a higher risk of dementia than women with sedentary jobs. This study supported earlier findings of a protective effect of LTPA on dementia among men. Women in physically demanding jobs possibly have a higher risk of dementia, yet this finding warrants further investigation in future studies.","K Nabe-Nielsen, A H Garde, F Gyntelberg, Å M Hansen, E Prescott, P Laursen, A Holtermann","Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports","2024Oct","Humans; Male; Female; Dementia; Leisure Activities; Denmark; Exercise; Middle Aged; Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Risk Factors; Occupations; Sex Factors; Adult"

This study aimed to model courses of competencies for health-enhancing PA across the spectrum of BMI. We used cross-sectional data of 3670 individuals (mean [SD]: BMI, 25.54 [5.71] kg/m2; age, 46.11 [14.96] years) from a large data pooling with 18 primary samples employing the PA-related health competence (PAHCO) instrument. ANCOVA determined differences in 10 PAHCO indicators by BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity). Covariate-adjusted multilevel models described the nonlinear courses of the PAHCO indicators across the BMI spectrum. The levels of all 10 PAHCO indicators differed significantly among the BMI categories (F ≥ 14.8; p < 0.001). All competencies for health-enhancing PA could be best described by cubic functions having their maximum around normal weight while regressing with underweight and with increasing grades of obesity (0.02 ≤  Rmarg2$$ {R}_{\mathrm{marg}}^2 $$  ≤ 0.31).

It is possible that cognitive difficulties are related to immune status and/or low mood. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between immune status and cognitive functioning in PCS, while considering whether depression symptoms also influence this association. Participants were recruited in an online study of cognitive and psychological consequences of PCS, involving individuals attending a post-COVID clinic in an acute general hospital in Ireland, and a comparison sample of age- and sex-matched community controls who had also been infected with COVID-19 but had not experienced PCS. Participants with PCS (n = 71) and community controls (n = 50) completed the immune status questionnaire, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F). Significant differences were observed between groups in terms of perceived immune status, perceived cognitive function, depression scores, and fatigue, with the ""PCS"" group reporting lower immune status, more cognitive difficulties, and higher levels of depression and fatigue. Regression analysis in the PCS group indicated that immune status and depression significantly contributed to variance in subjective cognitive functioning, with immune status remaining a significant predictor of cognitive functioning scores even when accounting for depression, fatigue, and other covariates related to PCS, such as Body Mass Index (BMI). Our findings suggest that subjective cognitive functioning is influenced by self-reported immune status in PCS, emphasising the importance of immune status, cognitive, and mood screening as part of routine clinical care in PCS.","Jessica Holland, Sinead Brown, Susan O'Flanagan, Stefano Savinelli, Kathleen McCann, Keith Gaynor, Patrick Mallon, Eoin Feeney, Grace Kenny, Christine Boyd, Fiadhnait O'Keeffe, Jessica Bramham","Brain and behavior","2024Sep","Humans; COVID-19; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Ireland; Self Report; Depression; Adult; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; Cognition; Fatigue; Aged; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; SARS-CoV-2"

It's a Cross-sectional study among 490 doctors aged 20-60 years at a tertiary hospital. Anthropometry, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids were assessed. NWO was defined as a BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 with a high body fat percentage. NWCO as normal BMI and increased waist circumference. Body composition was assessed using an Omron body composition analyzer. The prevalence of overall obesity was 101 (20%), NWO 239 (48.7%), and NWCO 210 (42.8%). Mean BMI, blood pressure, glucose, and LDL increased from normal weight to NWO/NWCO groups (p < 0.05). NWO and NWCO had significantly higher odds of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and high fasting blood sugar compared to non-obese after adjusting for confounders.

This research included hospitalized CAP individuals (≥ 60 years) and was conducted at a teaching hospital in western China. All the patients were categorized into three populations based on two BMI cutoff values (18.5 kg/m2 and 24 kg/m2). The data was acquired from medical records, local government mortality databases, and telephone interviews. Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to explore the associations between low HSA and septic shock and in-hospital mortality, and Cox regression analysis was used to explore the association between low HSA and out-of-hospital mortality. A total of 627 patients were included in the analysis of in-hospital death and septic shock, and 431 patients were included in the analysis of out-of-hospital death. The study showed that 120 elderly patients with CAP (19.14%) died in the hospital, while 141 patients (32.71%) died out of the hospital, and 93 patients (14.83%) developed septic shock. No differences in in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality were observed for BMI values < 18.5 kg/m2 or BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2, regardless of whether HSA was ≥ 40 g/l or < 40 g/l. When 18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 24 kg/m2, patients with HSA < 40 g/l had both higher in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality compared with those with HSA ≥ 40 g/l (in-hospital death: 26.13% vs. 11.46%, p < 0.001; out-of-hospital death: 46.15% vs. 19.17%, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of septic shock between patients with HSA < 40 g/l and those with HSA ≥ 40 g/l either in the overall population or when the BMI values were divided according to the cutoff values of 18.5 kg/m2 and 24 kg/m2. After further logistic regression analysis and adjustment for potential confounders, the results showed that when 18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 24 kg/m2, elderly CAP patients with HSA < 40 g/l had a higher risk of in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality compared with those with HSA ≥ 40 g/l (in-hospital death: HR = 1.964, 95%CI = 1.08-3.573; out-of-hospital death: HR = 2.841, 95%CI = 1.745-4.627).

However, the inclusion of earlier-stage disease was a limitation in previous studies. Patients with cT3-4 gastric cancer, determined by surgical staging to minimize migration of earlier stages, treated at a tertiary cancer center from 2009 to 2018 were included. Based on the surgical approach, the patients were divided into two groups: the laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) and the open gastrectomy (OG) and matched for age, sex, macroscopic appearance (type 4 or non-type 4), body mass index, estimated tumor size, clinical stage T3'T4, clinical N stage, pathologic T stage (T3 or T4), and type of surgery (total or distal gastrectomy). 588 patients (221 LG, 367 OG) were included in the analysis. After 1:1 propensity-score matching, 386 patients (193 LG, 193 OG) were assigned for analysis. In the LG group, operation time was longer with lower blood loss. The incidence of postoperative complications (≥ grade III) did not differ significantly between the groups (OG: 8.3%, vs. LG: 9.3%). Overall survival (OS) was longer in the LG group (5-year OS: 79.3 vs. 73% HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.99, P = 0.0497).

We sought to establish the point prevalence of abnormally elevated concentrations of SAbs among patients with pathological gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or hiatal hernia undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS). For this cross-sectional study, we retrieved a plasma aliquot from the Norton Thoracic Institute BioBank from blood samples that were taken preoperatively from patients who underwent ARS between November 2019 and August 2022. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were employed to detect and quantify anti-Col-V and anti-Kα1T. Samples from 43 patients (females, n = 34 [79.1%]; mean age, 62 ± 12 years; and mean BMI, 30.5 ± 7  kg/m2) were analyzed. Before ARS, 28 (65.1%, CI95: 50.3-80.0%) patients had abnormally elevated concentrations of anti-Col-V and 19 (44.2%, CI95: 28.7-59.7%) had elevated concentrations of circulating anti-Kα1T. Overall, 13 patients (30.2%) had low (i.e., normal) concentrations of both SAbs, 13 (30.2%) were positive only for one, and 17 (39.5%) were positive for both SAbs. A relative high point prevalence of abnormally elevated circulating SAbs (i.e., anti-Col-V and/or anti-Kα1T) before ARS was found. This result suggests clinically unsuspected pulmonary parenchymal injury secondary to GERD-related aspiration. Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis and to identify alternative non-invasive early biomarkers of GERD-related lung damage.","Andrés R Latorre-Rodríguez, Sumeet K Mittal, Ranjithkumar Ravichandran, Mark Shacker, Andrés Isaza-Restrepo, Sandhya Bansal, Thalachallour Mohankumar, Ross M Bremner","Lung","2024Sep24",NA
"39317881","Factors associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia and unsuccessful nasogastric tube removal after endovascular thrombectomy for anterior circulation stroke.","To identify the predictive variables for post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) among anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). This retrospective cohort study enrolled hospitalized patients with anterior LVO stroke who underwent EVT between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2022. PSD was defined as the unsuccessful removal of the nasogastric (NG) tube. Factors, such as premorbid characteristics, laboratory results, EVT, rehabilitation-related parameters, and neuro-imaging, were analyzed for correlations to PSD at 4 and 12 weeks. The study enrolled 136 patients, with a mean age of 72.9 ± 13.0 years, and 59 patients (43.4%) were male. At 4 weeks, 47.1% of the patients needed an NG tube, and at 12 weeks, 16.2% still required an NG tube. We found that lower albumin, lower body mass index (BMI), higher initial and 24-h post-EVT National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, stroke-associated pneumonia, poor initial sitting balance and ability to sit up, insula or frontal operculum lesions, and bilateral hemisphere involvement were all associated with PSD at both 4 and 12 weeks in the univariate logistic regression. Multivariate analysis revealed that significant predictors of unsuccessful NG tube removal at 4 weeks included lower BMI (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.73, p = 0.005), hemorrhagic transformation (aOR 4.01, p = 0.0335), higher NIHSS scores at 24 h post-EVT (aOR 1.13, p = 0.0288), poor initial sitting ability (aOR 0.52, p = 0.0231), insular cortex ischemia (aOR 7.26, p = 0.0056), and bilateral hemisphere involvement (aOR 41.19, p < 0.0001). At 12 weeks, lower BMI (aOR 0.78, p = 0.0098), poor initial sitting balance (aOR 0.57, p = 0.0287), insular cortex lesions (aOR 4.83, p = 0.0092), and bilateral hemisphere involvement (aOR 4.07, p = 0.0139) remained significant predictors. In patients with anterior LVO following EVT, PSD was associated with lower BMI, higher NIHSS scores, poor initial sitting balance and sitting ability, insular lesions, and bilateral hemisphere involvement.","Shu-Mei Yang, Hao-Wei Wu, Hsueh-Wen Hsueh, Yen-Heng Lin, Ting-Ju Lai, Meng-Ting Lin","European geriatric medicine","2024Sep24",NA
"39317803","Lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease.","Lupus nephritis is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a determinant of overall morbidity and mortality, as lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD) drives cardiovascular disease and secondary immunodeficiency. Two lines of action are required to prevent the progression of lupus nephritis-related CKD: suppression of autoimmune SLE activity, which is a risk factor for immunopathology-related irreversible kidney injury, and management of non-immune risk factors that contribute to CKD progression. As each episode or relapse of active lupus nephritis implicates CKD progression, preventing flares of lupus nephritis is a key treatment target. Non-immune risk factors of CKD mostly include causes of nephron hyperfiltration, such as obesity, hypertension, sodium- or protein-rich diets and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as pregnancy. Nephrotoxic agents and smoking also drive kidney cell loss. Intrinsic risk factors for CKD progression include poor nephron endowment because of prematurity at birth, nephropathic genetic variants, ageing, male sex and previous or concomitant kidney diseases. Care for lupus nephritis involves the control of all modifiable risk factors of CKD progression. In addition, remnant nephron overload can be reduced using early dual therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and sodium-glucose transporter-2, whereas further renoprotective drug interventions are underway. As patients with lupus nephritis are at risk of CKD progression, they would all benefit from interdisciplinary care to minimize the risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and infections.","Julia Lichtnekert, Hans-Joachim Anders","Nature reviews.

"39317703","Association of metabolic obesity phenotypes with risk of overall and site-specific cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.","Adiposity is a known risk factor for certain cancers; however, it is not clear whether the risk of cancer differs between individuals with high adiposity but different metabolic health status. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis of cohort studies was to evaluate associations between metabolic obesity phenotypes and overall and site-specific cancer risk. PubMed and Embase databases were used to identify relevant cohort studies up to the 6th of June 2023. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between metabolic obesity phenotypes and cancer risk. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane methods and the GRADE tool. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42024549511. A total of 15,556 records were screened, and 31 publications covering 15 unique cohort studies were included in this analysis. Of these studies, 22 were evaluated as being at low risk of bias and 9 at moderate risk of bias. Compared to metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy overweight/obese (MUOW/OB) individuals had a higher risk of overall (SRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.02-1.44, n = 3 studies, high certainty) and obesity-related cancers (SRR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.15-1.74, n = 3, very low certainty). Specifically, MUOW/OB individuals were at higher risk of cancers of the postmenopausal breast (SRR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.17-1.48, n = 7, low certainty), colorectum (SRR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.16-1.31, n = 6, moderate certainty), endometrium (SRR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.08-2.57, n = 4, high certainty), thyroid (SRR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.29-1.57, n = 4, moderate certainty), kidney (SRR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.40-2.10, n = 3, low certainty), pancreas (SRR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24-1.47, n = 3, high certainty), liver (SRR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.36-2.42, n = 2, moderate certainty), gallbladder (SRR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.17-1.73, n = 2, high certainty), bladder (SRR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.19-1.56, n = 2, moderate certainty), and stomach (SRR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.12-2.01, n = 2, high certainty). In addition, we found elevated risks of most of these cancers among individuals classified as MUNW and MHOW/OB phenotypes compared to those with MHNW phenotype. Our stratified analyses according to metabolic obesity phenotypes suggested that the elevated risks of some cancers were stronger in individuals with MUOW/OB versus those with MHOW/OB or MUNW phenotypes. These findings suggest that both higher adiposity and metabolic dysfunction were independently associated with increased risk of several cancers, with the strongest associations generally observed among those with both metabolic dysfunction and obesity.","Yahya Mahamat-Saleh, Dagfinn Aune, Heinz Freisling, Sheetal Hardikar, Rola Jaafar, Sabina Rinaldi, Marc J Gunter, Laure Dossus","British journal of cancer","2024Sep24",NA
"39317491","Comparative effectiveness trial of metformin versus insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes in the USA: clinical trial protocol for the multicentre DECIDE study.","Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Glycaemic control decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the affected pregnant individual and the infant exposed in utero. One in four individuals with GDM will require pharmacotherapy to achieve glycaemic control. Injectable insulin has been the mainstay of pharmacotherapy. Oral metformin is an alternative option increasingly used in clinical practice. Both insulin and metformin reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but comparative effectiveness data from a well-characterised, adequately powered study of a diverse US population remain lacking. Because metformin crosses the placenta, long-term safety data, in particular, the risk of childhood obesity, from exposed children are also needed. In addition, the patient-reported experiences of individuals with GDM requiring pharmacotherapy remain to be characterised, including barriers to and facilitators of metformin versus insulin use. In a two-arm open-label, pragmatic comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial, we will determine if metformin is not inferior to insulin in reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes, is comparably safe for exposed individuals and children, and if patient-reported factors, including facilitators of and barriers to use, differ between metformin and insulin. We plan to recruit 1572 pregnant individuals with GDM who need pharmacotherapy at 20 US sites using consistent diagnostic and treatment criteria for oral metformin versus injectable insulin and follow them and their children through delivery to 2 years post partum.

"39317398","Optimal Postextubation Support in Critically Ill Patients: One Size Does Not Fit All.","Extubation is a crucial step in the weaning process of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. Some patients may develop postextubation respiratory failure that may lead to the need for re-intubation, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review comprehensively explores postextubation respiratory support strategies, focusing on the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in reducing re-intubation rates among various patient populations. HFNC improves oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing. However, its effectiveness in preventing re-intubation varies according to the patient's characteristics and the predefined risk for re-intubation. NIV, alternatively, appears to provide substantial advantages in reducing the rates of re-intubation and respiratory failure, especially in patients with obesity and patients with hypercapnia. Therefore, the indiscriminate application of these support strategies without consideration of individual patient characteristics may not improve outcomes, highlighting the need for careful patient selection and tailored therapeutic strategies based on specific risk factors and clinical conditions. By aligning postextubation respiratory support strategies with patient-specific needs, we may improve the success rates of extubation, enhance overall recovery, and reduce the burden of reintubations in the intensive care setting.","Marina García-de-Acilu, Armand Sellas, Gonzalo Hernandez, Oriol Roca","Respiratory care","2024Sep24",NA

Although the QMCOO is useful in screening for frailty, its cutoff values for predicting adverse health outcomes have rarely been assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to calculate the cutoff values for predicting all-cause mortality and disability incidence and to evaluate their predictive validity. This study included 3837 health checkup recipients aged ≥75 years residing in Higashiura Town, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The health checkup was conducted from June 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Mortality and disability incidence were analyzed separately. For the latter, participants with a disability history were excluded, leaving 3040 available for analysis. During the follow-up of 11 191 and 8550 person-years, 276 died and 438 developed a disability, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality and disability incidence were 0.68 (0.65-0.71) and 0.66 (0.63-0.68), respectively, with QMCOO cutoff values at 3/4 and 2/3 points. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, self-reported diseases, and frequency of alcohol consumption demonstrated the predictive validity of those cutoff values.

This study aimed to compare the postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing TKA with or without patellar resurfacing using the same implant design. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent TKA including those with patellar resurfacing (PR group) and those without (NPR group). Demographic data included age, gender, side of surgery, operative time, and BMI. Outcomes included preoperative, 2-week, 6-week, and 1-year postoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) values along with knee range of motion (ROM). Postoperative complications were recorded. The power analysis with a large effect size indicated that a minimum sample size of 54 was required for the student t-test and 34 for the paired t-test. A total of 90 medial pivot (MP) TKA were included in this study. There were 30 knees in the PR group and 60 in the NPR group. There was no significant difference between the groups for all demographic data, preoperative and postoperative ROM, and KOOS, JR values at all time points (p>0.05 for all variables). The KOOS, JR significantly improved in the NPR groups at 2-week, 6-week, and 1-year postoperatively when compared to the preoperative score and at 6-week and 1-year postoperatively in the PR group (p<0.01). No revisions related to the patellofemoral joint were observed in patients initially undergoing patellar resurfacing. One patient in the NPR group required secondary patellar resurfacing. The patella-friendly MP TKA yielded favorable postoperative outcomes, with or without patellar resurfacing. Improvements in KOOS, JR were observed earlier in the NPR group when compared to the PR group, suggesting that patellar resurfacing may not always be necessary for modern TKA designs.","Leo Cooper, Brewer Owen, Tatsuya Soeno, Stephen Wahl, Benjamin Stronach, Lowry Barnes, Simon C Mears, Jeffrey Stambough","The journal of knee surgery","2024Sep24",NA

We examined cancer mortality patterns by demographic groups across geographic region (Delta vs non-Delta) and investigated the influence of macro-level social determinants of health (SDoH) in cancer death. This observational study included cancer death records of individuals aged ≥20 years from 2018 to 2021 in the United States. County-level characteristics were ascertained through the linkage of multiple national administrative and community surveys. We estimated age-standardized mortality rates (ASR) and rate ratios. We calculated the adjusted relative risks by county-level SDoH (geographic region, rurality, household income, income inequality, health insurance, and education) and other factors using age-adjusted multivariate quasi-Poisson regression. In 2018-2021, approximately 2.4 million cancer deaths occurred in the United States. We observed important declines in the Black-White disparities, from 16.6% in 2018 (ASR = 289.9 vs 248.6 per 100,000) to 12.1% in 2021 (281.1 vs 250.8) in the Delta region and from 15.9% (254.9 vs 219.9) to 10.7% (240.6 vs 217.3) in the non-Delta region, though Black men in the Delta region remained the highest rate (ASR2021 = 346.9 per 100,000).

Using resources from colorectal cancer consortia including 45,247 CRC cases and 52,671 controls, we assessed multiplicative and additive interaction (relative excess risk due to interaction, RERI) using logistic regression between 13 harmonized environmental factors and genetic risk score including 141 variants associated with CRC risk. There was no evidence of multiplicative interaction between environmental factors and genetic risk score. There was additive interaction where, for individuals with high genetic susceptibility, either heavy drinking [RERI = 0.24, 95% confidence interval, CI, (0.13, 0.36)], ever smoking [0.11 (0.05, 0.16)], high BMI [female 0.09 (0.05, 0.13), male 0.10 (0.05, 0.14)], or high red meat intake [highest versus lowest quartile 0.18 (0.09, 0.27)] was associated with excess CRC risk greater than that for individuals with average genetic susceptibility. Conversely, we estimate those with high genetic susceptibility may benefit more from reducing CRC risk with aspirin/NSAID use [-0.16 (-0.20, -0.11)] or higher intake of fruit, fiber, or calcium [highest quartile versus lowest quartile -0.12 (-0.18, -0.050); -0.16 (-0.23, -0.09); -0.11 (-0.18, -0.05), respectively] than those with average genetic susceptibility.

In addition, obesity is a well-established risk factor for complications after TKA. The purpose of this study was to analyze trends in body mass index (BMI) and complication risk among obese patients undergoing primary TKA treated at a single institution over 3 decades. Utilizing an institutional total joint registry, 13,919 primary TKAs performed to treat osteoarthritis between 1990 and 2019 were identified. Patients were stratified by BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification into 3 groups: non-obese (BMI, <30 kg/m2), WHO Class-I and II obese (BMI, 30 to 39.9 kg/m2), and WHO Class-III obese (BMI, ≥40 kg/m2). Trends in BMI and survivorship free from reoperation, revision, and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) were analyzed over time while controlling for age, sex, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Over the study period, there was a 90% increase in the prevalence of Class-II obesity (13% to 25%) and a 300% increase in Class-III obesity (3% to 12%). Analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated a decrease in the 2-year risk of any reoperation, any revision, and PJI (p < 0.05 for all) with time. The risk decreased significantly over time for non-obese patients for any reoperation (p = 0.029) and any revision (p = 0.004) and for Class-III obese patients for any reoperation (p = 0.038) and any revision (p = 0.012), but it remained stable for Class-I and II obese patients. The risk of PJI decreased from 1990 to 2019 for non-obese patients (p = 0.005), but there were no significant changes in PJI risk for any obesity group. Despite increasing rates of obesity among our patients who underwent TKA, we observed decreasing risks of reoperation, revision, and PJI over time. The risks of reoperation and revision declined among non-obese patients, remained stable for Class-I and II obese patients, and declined for Class-III obese patients. The PJI risk declined for non-obese patients over the study period, but no such decline occurred for any category of obesity. Despite the decreasing risks of reoperation and revision, further work is needed to improve PJI risk in obese patients. Therapeutic Level III.

"39316655","Increases in Psychological Stress Are Associated With Higher Fasting Glucose in US Chinese Immigrants.","The majority of Chinese Americans is foreign-born, and it is well-documented that immigration to the United States (US) leads to increased risk for chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes. Increased disease risk has been attributed to changes in lifestyle behaviors following immigration, but few studies have considered the psychosocial impact of immigration upon biomarkers of disease risk. To examine associations of psychological stress and social isolation with markers of type 2 diabetes risk over time among US Chinese immigrants. In this longitudinal study of 614 Chinese immigrants, participants completed assessments of perceived stress, acculturative stress, negative life events, and social isolation annually at three time points. Fasting blood samples were obtained at each time point to measure blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and insulin resistance. Mean duration between baseline and follow-up assessments was approximately 2 years. Increases in migration-related stress, perceived stress and social isolation were associated with significant increases in fasting glucose at follow-up independent of age, body mass index, length of US residence, and other potential covariates. Moreover, increases in glucose varied depending on perceived stress levels at baseline, such that those with higher baseline stress had a steeper increase in glucose over time. Psychological stress and social isolation are associated with increases in fasting glucose in a sample of US Chinese immigrants. Findings suggest that the unique experiences of immigration may be involved in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, a condition that is prevalent among US Chinese despite relatively low rates of obesity.","Carolyn Y Fang, Ajay Rao, Elizabeth A Handorf, Mengying Deng, Peter Cheung, Marilyn Tseng","Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine","2024Sep24",NA
"39316596","Development, characterization, and replication of proteomic aging clocks: Analysis of 2 population-based cohorts.","Biological age may be estimated by proteomic aging clocks (PACs). Previous published PACs were constructed either in smaller studies or mainly in white individuals, and they used proteomic measures from only one-time point. In this study, we created de novo PACs and compared their performance to published PACs at 2 different time points in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of white and black participants (around 75% white and 25% black). A total of 4,712 plasma proteins were measured using SomaScan in blood samples collected in 1990 to 1992 from 11,761 midlife participants (aged 46 to 70 years) and in 2011 to 2013 from 5,183 late-life participants (aged 66 to 90 years). The de novo ARIC PACs were constructed by training them against chronological age using elastic net regression in two-thirds of healthy participants in midlife and late life and validated in the remaining one-third of healthy participants at the corresponding time point. We also computed 3 published PACs. We estimated age acceleration for each PAC as residuals after regressing each PAC on chronological age. We also calculated the change in age acceleration from midlife to late life. We examined the associations of age acceleration and change in age acceleration with mortality through 2019 from all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and lower respiratory disease (LRD) using Cox proportional hazards regression in participants (irrespective of health) after excluding the training set. The model was adjusted for chronological age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and other confounders. We externally validated the midlife PAC using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Exam 1 data. The ARIC PACs had a slightly stronger correlation with chronological age than published PACs in healthy participants at each time point. Associations with mortality were similar for the ARIC PACs and published PACs. For late-life and midlife age acceleration for the ARIC PACs, respectively, hazard ratios (HRs) per 1 standard deviation were 1.65 and 1.38 (both p < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.37 and 1.20 (both p < 0.001) for CVD mortality, 1.21 (p = 0.028) and 1.04 (p = 0.280) for cancer mortality, and 1.46 and 1.68 (both p < 0.001) for LRD mortality. For the change in age acceleration, HRs for all-cause, CVD, and LRD mortality were comparable to the HRs for late-life age acceleration. The association between the change in age acceleration and cancer mortality was not significant. The external validation of the midlife PAC in MESA showed significant associations with mortality, as observed for midlife participants in ARIC. The main limitation is that our PACs were constructed in midlife and late-life participants. It is unknown whether these PACs could be applied to young individuals. In this longitudinal study, we found that the ARIC PACs and published PACs were similarly associated with an increased risk of mortality. These findings suggested that PACs show promise as biomarkers of biological age. PACs may be serve as tools to predict mortality and evaluate the effect of anti-aging lifestyle and therapeutic interventions.","Shuo Wang, Zexi Rao, Rui Cao, Anne H Blaes, Josef Coresh, Rajat Deo, Ruth Dubin, Corinne E Joshu, Benoit Lehallier, Pamela L Lutsey, James S Pankow, Wendy S Post, Jerome I Rotter, Sanaz Sedaghat, Weihong Tang, Bharat Thyagarajan, Keenan A Walker, Peter Ganz, Elizabeth A Platz, Weihua Guan, Anna Prizment","PLoS medicine","2024Sep24",NA
"39316396","Preconception HbA1c Levels in Adolescents and Young Adults and Adverse Birth Outcomes.","Subclinical hyperglycemia before pregnancy may be associated with the likelihood of maternal morbidity but is understudied among young people. To explore the association of preconception hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels among adolescents and young adults with risk of gestational diabetes at first live birth. This retrospective cohort study used linked 2009 to 2017 birth registry, hospital discharge, and New York City Department of Health A1C Registry data for birthing individuals aged 10 to 24 years with no history of diabetes and at least 1 preconception HbA1c test in New York, New York. Statistical analysis was performed from August to November 2022. Preconception HbA1c values categorized as no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%) or prediabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7% to <6.5%). The primary outcome was gestational diabetes at first birth. Secondary outcomes included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, cesarean delivery, and macrosomia. Log binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of gestational diabetes at first birth by preconception HbA1c level, adjusting for prepregnancy characteristics. The optimal HbA1c threshold for gestational diabetes was examined using receiver operating curve regression. A total of 14 302 individuals (mean [SD] age, 22.10 [1.55] years) met study eligibility criteria. Of these, 5896 (41.0%) were Hispanic, 4149 (29.0%) were Black, 2583 (18.1%) were White, 1516 (10.6%) were Asian, and 185 (1.3%) had other or unknown race and ethnicity. Most (11 407 individuals [79.7%]) had normoglycemia before pregnancy, and 2895 individuals (20.2%) had prediabetes. Adjusting for prepregnancy characteristics, those with preconception prediabetes had more than twice the risk of gestational diabetes vs those with normoglycemia (adjusted RR [aRR], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.91-2.56). Preconception prediabetes was associated with small increases in the likelihood of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (aRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.35) and preterm delivery (aRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37). The aRRs for cesarean delivery (aRR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20) and macrosomia (aRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93-1.37) were increased but not statistically significant. The optimal HbA1c threshold to identify gestational diabetes among adolescents and young adults was 5.6%. The threshold did not vary by obesity status but was slightly lower among Hispanic individuals (HbA1c of 5.5%). In this study of adolescents and young adults with at least 1 preconception HbA1c test, prediabetes was associated with increased likelihood of maternal cardiometabolic morbidity at first birth. Efforts to optimize cardiometabolic health before pregnancy may avert excess maternal risk.","Katharine J McCarthy, Shelley H Liu, Joseph Kennedy, Hiu Tai Chan, Frances Howell, Natalie Boychuk, Victoria L Mayer, Luciana Vieira, Bahman Tabaei, Kacie Seil, Gretchen Van Wye, Teresa Janevic","JAMA network open","2024Sep03","Humans; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin; Pregnancy; Adolescent; Young Adult; Retrospective Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; New York City; Pregnancy Outcome; Prediabetic State; Premature Birth; Child; Adult"
"39316152","The intergenerational metabolic-cardiovascular life course: maternal body mass index (BMI), offspring BMI, and blood pressure of adolescents born extremely preterm.","The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between pre-pregnancy maternal obesity and adolescent blood pressures (BPs) among children born extremely preterm. This longitudinal observational cohort study included participants in the multicenter Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) study, born before 28 weeks of gestation, recruited at birth between 2002 and 2004, and followed prospectively through late adolescence. Between 2015 and 2022, three oscillometric BPs were obtained from participants (mean age 17.8 years). We used linear regression modeling to evaluate the association between maternal self-reported pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and offspring adolescent systolic BP (SBP). In secondary analyses, we evaluated the association between maternal pre-pregnancy and offspring preadolescent (10-year-old) BMI and between offspring preadolescent BMI and adolescent SBP. The 100 (24%) participants born to a mother with a history of pre-pregnancy obesity (BMI ≥ 30) had a greater mean SBP of 120.5 (± 14.3) mmHg compared to the 324 (76%) of adolescents born to mothers without pre-pregnancy obesity (SBP 115.6 (± 12.0) mmHg). Pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with higher offspring BMI (aβ 10.8, 95% CI 2.3, 19.2), and higher offspring BMI was associated with higher adolescent SBP (aβ 0.12, 95% CI 0.09,0.16). For ELGANs, higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with higher adolescent SBP. Findings from secondary analyses suggest potential mediation through preadolescent BMI. Future research directions include multi-level interventions to reduce maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, followed by offspring obesity prevention interventions as a way of reducing intergenerational cardiovascular disease in high-risk infants born extremely preterm.","Keia Sanderson, Ali Oran, Rachana Singh, Semsa Gogcu, Eliana M Perrin, Lisa Washburn, Vasyl Zhabotynsky, Andrew M South, Elizabeth T Jensen, Rebecca C Fry, T Michael O'Shea","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)","2024Sep24",NA
"39315899","Fat Suppression in Distal Extremity 3-T MRI Using Spectral Heterogeneity Adaptive Radiofrequency Pulses.","Background Conventional chemical shift selective (CHESS) fat suppression may fail in distal extremity MRI due to sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. Purpose To develop a patient-specific fat-suppression method for distal extremity 3-T MRI by exploiting the spectral heterogeneity adaptive radiofrequency pulse (SHARP) technique and to compare it to fat suppression with CHESS. Materials and Methods SHARP uses the routinely acquired frequency spectrum at MRI calibration to adapt the frequency range and time-bandwidth product of the fat-suppression pulse. In this prospective study, fat suppression by SHARP was assessed by numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and imaging in 15 asymptomatic participants who underwent ankle, foot, and hand (in superman and hand-by-the-side positions) MRI using SHARP, CHESS, and reference standard (short-tau inversion recovery or Dixon) techniques. Three readers ranked the MRI scans from 1 (best) to 3 (worst) regarding fat-suppression homogeneity. The added value of SHARP was defined as the difference between the proportions of images where SHARP outranked CHESS and where CHESS outranked SHARP. Friedman, Wilcoxon signed rank, and χ2 tests were used to compare in vivo data. Results At numerical simulations, SHARP showed 0% water and 62%-70% fat suppression, whereas CHESS showed 2% water and 57% fat suppression. Phantom data demonstrated lower fat-suppression inhomogeneity indexes with Dixon (1.0%) and SHARP (2.4%) compared with CHESS (10.7%). In 15 participants (mean age, 38.5 years ± 12.8 [SD]; six female participants), mean ranking by readers of fat homogeneity in the reference technique (ankle, foot, hand in superman position, and hand-by-the-side position: 1.02, 1.02, 1.03, and 1.06, respectively) was higher than those with SHARP (1.39, 1.46, 1.50, and 1.66, respectively), which were higher than those with CHESS (1.64, 1.80, 1.61, and 1.80, respectively) (all P < .001). The added value of SHARP was highest for images in the foot (389 of 1158; 33.6%; P < .001 vs other joints), followed by the ankle (247 of 971 [25%]; P < .001 vs both hand positions), and lowest for hand-by-the-side and hand in superman positions (158 of 1223; [13%] and 133 of 1193 [11%], respectively; P = .18).

"39315897","Photon-counting Detector CT for Liver Fat Quantification: Validation across Protocols in Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease.","Background Traditional energy-integrating detector CT has limited utility in accurately quantifying liver fat due to protocol-induced CT value shifts, but this limitation can be addressed by using photon-counting detector (PCD) CT, which allows for a standardized CT value. Purpose To develop and validate a universal CT to MRI fat conversion formula to enhance fat quantification accuracy across various PCD CT protocols relative to MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Materials and Methods In this prospective study, the feasibility of fat quantification was evaluated in phantoms with various nominal fat fractions. Five hundred asymptomatic participants and 157 participants with suspected metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were enrolled between September 2023 and March 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to six groups with different CT protocols regarding tube voltage (90, 120, or 140 kVp) and radiation dose (standard or low). Of the participants in the 120-kVp standard-dose asymptomatic group, 51% (53 of 104) were designated as the training cohort, with the rest of the asymptomatic group serving as the validation cohort. A CT to MRI fat quantification formula was derived from the training cohort to estimate the CT-derived fat fraction (CTFF). CTFF agreement with PDFF and its error were evaluated in the asymptomatic validation cohort and subcohorts stratified by tube voltage, radiation dose, and body mass index, and in the MASLD cohort. The factors influencing CTFF error were further evaluated. Results In the phantoms, CTFF showed excellent agreement with nominal fat fraction (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.98; mean bias, 0.2%). A total of 412 asymptomatic participants and 122 participants with MASLD were included. A CT to MRI fat conversion formula was derived as follows: MRI PDFF (%) = -0.58 · CT (HU) + 43.1. Across all comparisons, CTFF demonstrated excellent agreement with PDFF (mean bias values < 1%). CTFF error was not influenced by tube voltage, radiation dose, body mass index, or PDFF. Agreement between CTFF and PDFF was also found in the MASLD cohort (mean bias, -0.2%). Conclusion Standardized CT value from PCD CT showed a robust and remarkable agreement with MRI PDFF across various protocols and may serve as a precise alternative for liver fat quantification. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

We used a dynamic microsimulation model based on Health and Retirement Study data to estimate the quantity and health quality of expected future life years for rural and urban Americans ages 59-60 in 2014-2020. Cohort life expectancy at age 60 (LE) for urban and rural men was 22.9 and 20.9, respectively; for urban and rural women, LE was 25.6 and 25.0, respectively. Adjusting future life years to quality-adjusted life years, QALE was 17.5 versus 15.7 for urban versus rural men, and 19.3 versus 18.7 for women. Compared to a cohort in 1994-2000, the urban-rural QALE gap in 2014-2020 grew substantially for men; changes for women were smaller. Average QALE masked heterogeneity by race/ethnicity, education, and Census region. Counterfactual scenarios suggested eliminating smoking and managing obesity and prevalent heart conditions would be particularly beneficial for increasing rural QALE and reducing the urban-rural gap. Expected health quality, in addition to longevity, is an important factor when assessing rural disparities in older Americans' future life outcomes. Current chronic disease disparities are expected to translate to a widening urban-rural gap in QALE, particularly for men. Interventions earlier in life may be needed to fully address disparities in QALE at older ages.","Jack M Chapel, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, Bryan Tysinger","The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association","2024Sep24",NA

The GDM group suffered distinctly higher serum concentrations of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tri(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), tri-iso-propyl phosphate (TIPP), and tri(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) than the healthy control group (p < 0.001). Traditional analysis methods employed for either individual or mixture effects found positive correlations (p < 0.05) between the concentrations of five OPEs (i.e., TNBP, TBOEP, TPHP, TIPP, and TCIPP) and the incidence of GDM, while 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate, tri(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate exhibited opposite effects. Three machine learning methods considering the concurrence of OPE mixture exposure and population characteristics were applied to clarify their relative importance to GDM risk, among which random forest performed the best. Several OPEs, particularly TNBP and TBOEP ranking at the top, made greater contributions than some demographical characteristics, such as prepregnancy body mass index and family history of diabetes, to the occurrence of GDM.

The impact of severe obesity on different aspects of biological age.","Obesity and aging are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to the onset of degenerative processes. The objective was to comprehensively analyze the prevalence of premature aging in obesity and identify metabolic factors influencing aging. In this prospective cohort study, the telomere length, 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine DNA damage, interleukin-6 (IL-6), metabolic age and cognitive functions were evaluated in the patients with severe obesity (study group (SG), defined as BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, n=100) and the healthy volunteers (control group (CG), defined as BMI 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2, n=33). SG was further divided into two subgroups: study group 1 (SG1) - subjects with BMI≥ 50 kg/m2 and study group 2 (SG2) with BMI < 50 kg/m2. Our findings revealed that individuals in the SG exhibited shorter telomeres, higher levels of inflammation, and more advanced metabolic age compared to those in the CG. However, no significant differences in DNA damage or cognitive function abilities were observed between the SG and CG. Notably, SG1 displayed elevated IL-6 levels compared to SG2. Furthermore, IL-6 levels decreased significantly with increasing body fat, and individuals with higher visceral fat levels had longer telomeres. Premature aging manifests in obesity concerning telomere length, inflammation levels and metabolic age. Aging in obesity should be considered as a non-linear process.","Alicja Dudek, Barbara Zapała, Ilona Kawa, Piotr Tylec, Karol Ciszek, Katarzyna Cyranka, Michał Wysocki, Piotr Major","Polish archives of internal medicine","2024Sep18",NA
"39315735","Breast cancer risk and prevention in 2024: An overview from the Breast Cancer UK - Breast Cancer Prevention Conference.","The Breast Cancer UK-Breast Cancer Prevention Conference addressed risk from environmental pollutants and health behaviour-related breast-cancer risk. Epidemiological studies examining individual chemicals and breast cancer risk have produced inconclusive results including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) Bisphenol A, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances as well as aluminium. However, laboratory studies have shown that multiple EDCs, can work together to exhibit effects, even when combined at levels that alone are ineffective. The TEXB-α/β assay measures total estrogenic load, and studies have provided evidence of a link between multiple-chemical exposures and breast cancer. However, prospective studies using TEXB-α/β are needed to establish a causative link. There is also a need to assess real-life exposure to environmental-chemical mixtures during pregnancy, and their potential involvement in programming adverse foetal health outcomes in later life. Higher rates of breast cancer have occurred alongside increases in potentially-modifiable risk factors such as obesity. Increasing body-mass index is associated with increased risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer, but with decreased risk of premenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, lower rates of breast cancer in Asian compared to Western populations have been linked to soya/isoflavone consumption. Risk is decreased by breastfeeding, which is in addition to the decrease in risk observed for each birth and a young first-birth. Risk is lower in those with higher levels of self-reported physical activity. Current evidence suggests breast-cancer survivors should also avoid weight gain, be physically active, and eat a healthy diet for overall health. A broad scientific perspective on breast cancer risk requires focus on both environmental exposure to chemicals and health behaviour-related risk. Research into chemical exposure needs to focus on chemical mixtures and prospective epidemiological studies in order to test the effects on breast cancer risk. Behaviour-related research needs to focus on implementation as well as deeper understanding of the mechanisms of cancer prevention.","Britta Stordal, Michelle Harvie, Michael N Antoniou, Michelle Bellingham, Doris S M Chan, Philippa Darbre, Oskar Karlsson, Andreas Kortenkamp, Pamela Magee, Stefano Mandriota, Elisabete Silva, James E Turner, Laura N Vandenberg, D Gareth Evans","Cancer medicine","2024Sep","Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Environmental Exposure; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants"

Among 2006 participants in the ARIC prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) who were free of overt cardiovascular disease and underwent echocardiography at study visits 5 (2011- 2013) and 7 (2018-2019), we assessed the associations of NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations at visit 5 with changes in left ventricular structure and function between visits 5 and 7 (≈7-year change) using multivariable linear regression with the biomarkers modeled as restricted cubic splines. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and renal function at visit 5; blood pressure and heart rate at both visits; and the baseline value of the echocardiographic parameter of interest. Mean±SD age was 74±4 years at visit 5; 61% were women; and 23% were Black adults. Median (25th-75th percentile) concentrations at visit 5 of NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI were 87 ng/L (50-157 ng/L), 9 ng/L (6-12 ng/L), and 2.6 ng/L (1.9-3.9 ng/L). In adjusted models, elevated baseline concentrations of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI were significantly associated with 7-year decline in left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction, longitudinal and circumferential strain) and worsening diastolic indices. In contrast, elevated baseline concentrations of hs-cTnT were not significantly associated with 7-year changes in cardiac structure, systolic function, or diastolic function (all P>0.05).

The study used quantitative adipose and muscle tissue measures derived from magnetic resonance imaging data from UK Biobank (N = 40,174). Fat distribution and muscle composition of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) users were compared with sex-, age-, and BMI-matched control individuals. Cox regression models were used to test for increased risk of developing CVD and type 2 diabetes. SSRI users had more visceral fat, smaller muscle volume, and higher muscle fat infiltration compared with matched control individuals. Female users showed a larger increase in BMI over time compared with male users. However, male users displayed an unhealthier body composition profile. Male SSRI users also had an increased risk of developing CVD. Both male and female TCA users showed lower muscle volume and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Adverse changes in body composition of antidepressant users are not captured by tracking the body weight or the BMI of the patients. These changes may lead to a worsened cardiometabolic risk profile.","Patrik Andersson, Jennifer Linge, Tiril P Gurholt, Ida E Sønderby, Guy Hindley, Ole A Andreassen, Olof Dahlqvist Leinhard","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","2024Oct","Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Body Composition; Antidepressive Agents; Adult; Body Mass Index; Muscle, Skeletal; Aged; Risk Factors; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Intra-Abdominal Fat; United Kingdom; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Case-Control Studies"

Increases at the 50th and 75th WC percentiles relative to BMI were more pronounced in women than in men, with larger increases in US non-Hispanic White individuals and in England. In men, increases in WC independent of BMI were most evident in Mexico. Disease risk associated with visceral fat is potentially underestimated by national surveillance efforts that quantify only secular changes in BMI.","Luz M Sánchez-Romero, Janine Sagaceta-Mejía, Jennifer S Mindell, Álvaro Passi-Solar, Antonio Bernabé-Ortiz, Lizbeth Tolentino-Mayo, Alison Moody, Shaun Scholes","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)","2024Oct","Humans; Male; Female; Waist Circumference; Adult; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; United States; Obesity, Abdominal; England; Mexico; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Peru; Obesity"
"39315383","Anthropometric indices in predicting 10-year cardiovascular risk among males and females aged 40-74 years in south and southeast Asia: analysis of 12 WHO STEPS survey data.","The relevance of anthropometric indices in predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors is established across different countries, particularly in the high-income countries. However, past studies severely lacked representation from the south and southeast Asian countries. The main aim of this study was to determine the performance of conventional and new anthropometric indices to best predict 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in south Asian and southeast Asian populations. The present study examined data from 14,532 participants in three south Asian and 13,846 participants (all aged between 40 and 74 years) in six southeast Asian countries, drawn from twelve cross-sectional studies (WHO STEPwise approaches to NCD risk factor surveillance [STEPS] survey data from 2008 to 2019). A Predictive performance of ten anthropometric indices were examined for predicting 10-year CVD risk ≥ 10% (CVD-R ≥ 10%). The 10-year CVD-R ≥ 10% was calculated by utilising the WHO CVD risk non-laboratory-based charts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify the optimal anthropometric index. Among the ten anthropometric indices, a body shape index (ABSI), body adiposity index (BAI), body roundness index (BRI), hip index (HI), and waist-height ratio (WHtR) performed best in predicting 10-year CVD risk among south Asian males and females. Improved performances were found for ABSI, BRI, conicity index (CI), WHtR, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) for 10-year CVD-R ≥ 10% predictions among southeast Asian males. Contrastingly, among southeast Asian females, ABSI and CI demonstrated optimal performance in predicting 10-year CVD-R ≥ 10%. The performance of anthropometric indices in predicting CVD risk varies across countries. ABSI, BAI, BRI, HI, and WHtR showed better predictions in south Asians, whereas ABSI, BRI, CI, WHtR, and WHR displayed enhanced predictions in southeast Asians.

"39315263","Metabolic Syndrome and Its Component Factors Among Corporate Company Employees in Kampala Uganda.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a cluster of metabolic dysregulations indicative of increased cardiometabolic risk is on the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS and its components, among corporate employees in Kampala, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 408 adults who were employees from seven corporate companies in Kampala, using the WHO STEPwise NCD screening approach. Metabolic syndrome was measured using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATPIII) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria with the waist circumference (WC) cut-off points adapted for Sub-Saharan African populations. The mean population age (standard deviation [SD]) of the respondents was 34years (± 8.87) years and 52% of them were females. The prevalence of MetS was 22.8% (NCEP ATPIII) and 28.4% (IDF). Of the respondents who did not have MetS, 75% had at least one metabolic dysregulation. Of those respondents with MetS, only 31% perceived that they were at risk of this cluster of metabolic dysregulations. In this analysis, we observed that the systolic blood pressure (BP) and the body mass index (BMI) correlated strongly (r = 0.81 and r = 0.71) with the diastolic BP and waist circumference (WC), respectively. Age on the other hand correlated fairly with the WC and BMI (both r values = 0.46). Principal component analysis showed that the greatest loadings in principle factors one, two and three were from central obesity, with low HDL-C explaining 60.8% variance in the population. Age, BMI, family history of having cardiometabolic disorders, and perceived cardiometabolic disease risk (CMR) were associated with an increased risk of MetS by 5, 8.86, 1.55, and 2.73 (all P values were < 0.05) respectively in this group of respondents. These risks remained for age, BMI and perceived CMR after removing the confounding effects of education status, marital status and family history of cardiometabolic disease. Being single on the other hand, was associated with a reduced risk of MetS (0.23, p < 0.009). While the primary contributors to the high prevalence of MetS among corporate employees in Kampala, Uganda were the high BP, high WC and high fasting blood sugar (FBS); age, BMI and perceived CMR were the key determinants of MetS. Future MetS interventions should aim to control and monitor obesity indicators in this population. Additionally, the findings inform targeted screening parameters for cardiometabolic risk assessment and suggest the need for further research into a weighted algorithm for MetS in this population.","Jemimah Kiboss Kyeyune, Zandile June-Rose Mchiza, Mwambi Bashir, Prossy Merab Ingabire, Florence Wamuyu Githinji, Florence Nakaggwa, Ivan Gabriel Busulwa, Rose Clarke Nanyonga","Research square","2024Sep11",NA

The ABCG2 rs2231142 variant (TT genotype) is associated with hyperuricemia (HUA), but the relationship between ABCG2 gene polymorphisms and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk is poorly elucidated. We investigated the association between ABCG2 rs2231142 genetic variants and the Framingham Risk Score for Cardiovascular Disease (FRS-CVD) in a Taiwanese population. This cross-sectional study enrolled 139,508 Taiwanese participants aged 30-70 years based on data from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) database that was obtained from questionnaires, laboratory investigations, anthropometry, and Affymetrix TWB genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip data analysis. The association between ABCG2 rs2231142 and FRS-CVD risk was evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Compared to those with the GG genotype, participants with the ABCG2 rs2231142 TT genotype had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure, smoking rate, body mass index, triglyceride level, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and body fat percentage, but had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Despite the same FRS-CVD score, participants with TT genotypes had higher SUA. Even with the same SUA, TT carriers had a lower FRS-CVD than GT and GG carriers. Participants with the TT genotype had significantly lower CVD risk, particularly female participants with HUA and BMI <27 (OR: 0.760, 95 % CI: 0.587-0.985; p = 0.0381) group. The ABCG2 rs2231142 TT genotype is associated with a lower FRS-CVD, particularly in non-obese hyperuricemic female individuals.

The coexistence of various malnutrition forms in the same household is a public health concern in developing countries. Very little research has been done on exploring the burden and risk factors associated with double (DBM) and triple burden of malnutrition (TBM). Secondary analysis was done using data from India's National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), 2019-21. Mothers and under-five children were paired at the household level as a unit of analysis. DBM and TBM were interpreted from children's height-for-age, weight-for-height, weight-for-age and anaemia status and mothers' body-mass-index. Stratification and clustering in the sample design were accounted for during the analysis in STATA v14.2. DBM and TBM were summarized as weighted proportions with 95 % confidence interval (CI) and the risk factors associated were reported as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95%CI using mixed effects logistic regression. We included 167,380 mother-child pairs for analysis. In India, the prevalence of DBM was 7.7 % (95 % CI: 7.5-7.9 %) and TBM was 5.1 % (5.0-5.3 %) at the household level among mother-child dyads. Mothers' age, age at first birth, educational levels, current breastfeeding habits, mode of delivery, child's age, gender, twin birth, birth weight, geographical region, residence, caste and religion, and wealth index were associated with both DBM and TBM. Both DBM and TBM are public health concerns in India. Thus, scaling-up of health intervention, effective implementation of nutritional programmes and life-course approach are needed to control malnutrition.","Premkumar Ramasubramani, Yuvaraj Krishnamoorthy, Sathish Rajaa","Heliyon","2024Sep30",NA
"39315066","The severity of distal sensory polyneuropathy increasing with HIV/AIDS stage.","Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common neurological problem in HIV/AIDS Patients. It represents a complex symptom that occurs because of peripheral nerve damage related to advanced HIV disease and in association with the use of antiretroviral therapy. DSP is a frequent symptom in which the specific pathophysiology is not well understood. Recently, mitochondrial toxicity and antiretroviral toxic neuropathies have been more identified as a possible etiology of DSP. This study's objective was to determine factors associated with DSP severity in HIV/AIDS patients. This cross-sectional study was followed by 50 HIV/AIDS outpatients at some hospitals in Makassar, Indonesia who met the inclusion criteria. DSP is diagnosed using non-invasive screening tools subjective peripheral neuropathy screen (SPNS) which can determine the severity of DSP in advance. Some factors were analyzed by using Pearson's chi-square test and Spearman's correlation test. Forty-three participants (86%) had diagnosed DSP which is mostly moderate in severity (48%). Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between HIV/AIDS Stage and DSP severity (p=0.032) meanwhile CD4 count, antiretroviral, body mass index (BMI), and hemoglobin level have no significant correlation to DSP severity.

"39315061","Reliable prediction of childhood obesity using only routinely collected EHRs may be possible.","Early identification of children at high risk of obesity can provide clinicians with the information needed to provide targeted lifestyle counseling to high-risk children at a critical time to change the disease course. This study aimed to develop predictive models of childhood obesity, applying advanced machine learning methods to a large unaugmented electronic health record (EHR) dataset. This work improves on other studies that have (i) relied on data not routinely available in EHRs (like prenatal data), (ii) focused on single-age predictions, or (iii) not been rigorously validated. A customized sequential deep-learning model to predict the development of obesity was built, using EHR data from 36,191 diverse children aged 0-10 years. The model was evaluated using extensive discrimination, calibration, and utility analysis; and was validated temporally, geographically, and across various subgroups. Our results are mostly better or comparable to similar studies. Specifically, the model achieved an AUROC above 0.8 in all cases (with most cases around 0.9) for predicting obesity within the next 3 years for children 2-7 years of age. Validation results show the model's robustness and top predictors match important risk factors of obesity. Our model can predict the risk of obesity for young children at multiple time points using only routinely collected EHR data, greatly facilitating its integration into clinical care. Our model can be used as an objective screening tool to provide clinicians with insights into a patient's risk for developing obesity so that early lifestyle counseling can be provided to prevent future obesity in young children.","Mehak Gupta, Daniel Eckrich, H Timothy Bunnell, Thao-Ly T Phan, Rahmatollah Beheshti","Obesity pillars","2024Dec",NA
"39315049","Mild hunger elicits attentional desensitization to visual food cues in healthy, non-obese individuals.","Food is a vital human need, and the human visual system is finely tuned to detect and respond to food cues in the environment. The omnipresence of food cues across various settings has been linked to the prevalence of obesity in susceptible populations. However, the influence of the post-prandial state on visual attention to food stimuli remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate how a 12 hour fast affects visual attention to food and non-food stimuli in healthy, non-obese individuals. Visual attention was assessed by measuring the total duration of visual fixations on stimuli presented on a computer screen, using a screen-based eye tracker (Tobii X2-60). Participants were divided into two groups: those who had fasted for 12 hours and those tested within two hours after consuming breakfast (satiated state). Additionally, performance on the Food Stroop task and electrodermal activity (EDA) responses were measured to evaluate attentional interference and physiological arousal, respectively. Salivary samples were also collected to assess levels of alpha-amylase and cortisol. Fasted participants exhibited a progressive decline in visual attention toward food stimuli compared to satiated individuals, reflecting a satiated state. This effect was independent of the palatability of the depicted food items and was not observed with stimuli representing non-food items. The Food Stroop task revealed no differences between fasting and satiated participants, indicating that the presence of food-related stimuli does not differentially impact attentional interference under varying hunger states. Moreover, no significant variations were observed in EDA responses across participant groups and stimulus types, suggesting that the modulation of visual attention to food cues by hunger is independent of physiological arousal. Interestingly, satiated subjects exhibited higher levels of salivary alpha-amylase, which was inversely related to their subjective hunger ratings. No differences in salivary cortisol levels were found between groups. The findings indicate a novel influence of mild hunger on the processing of visual food cues, independent of physiological arousal. The decline in visual attention to food stimuli in fasted individuals suggests that satiety modulates visual processing. The lack of differences in attentional interference and physiological arousal between fasting and satiated states further supports the notion that visual attention to food cues is primarily driven by hunger-related mechanisms rather than stress. Additionally, the inverse relationship between salivary alpha-amylase levels and hunger ratings implies that alpha-amylase may serve as a marker of satiety rather than stress.","Nicol Schlezingerová, Petra Málková, Martin Kocourek, Petr Telenský","Frontiers in psychology","2024",NA

Artificial intelligence (AI) could enable fSAD quantification from chest CT scan at total lung capacity (TLC) alone (fSADTLC). To evaluate an AI model for estimating fSADTLC and study its clinical associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed 2513 participants from the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). Using a subset (n = 1055), we developed a generative model to produce virtual expiratory CTs for estimating fSADTLC in the remaining 1458 SPIROMICS participants. We compared fSADTLC with dual volume, parametric response mapping fSADPRM. We investigated univariate and multivariable associations of fSADTLC with FEV1, FEV1/FVC, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and FEV1 decline. The results were validated in a subset (n = 458) from COPDGene study. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, baseline FEV1, smoking pack years, smoking status, and percent emphysema. Inspiratory fSADTLC was highly correlated with fSADPRM in SPIROMICS (Pearson's R = 0.895) and COPDGene (R = 0.897) cohorts. In SPIROMICS, fSADTLC was associated with FEV1 (L) (adj.β = -0.034, P < 0.001), FEV1/FVC (adj.β = -0.008, P < 0.001), SGRQ (adj.β = 0.243, P < 0.001), and FEV1 decline (mL / year) (adj.β = -1.156, P < 0.001). fSADTLC was also associated with FEV1 (L) (adj.β = -0.032, P < 0.001), FEV1/FVC (adj.β = -0.007, P < 0.001), SGRQ (adj.β = 0.190, P = 0.02), and FEV1 decline (mL / year) (adj.β = -0.866, P = 0.001) in COPDGene.

Better understanding of comor-bidities will allow for enhanced screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients. To investigate prevalence and associations of IED with psychiatric, neurological, and somatic disorders using real-world data. Matched cohorts of patients with or without IED diagnosis were identified using data from the TriNetX Research Network (until January 31, 2024). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate and compare the probabilities of acquiring other diagnoses using pa-tients' available medical records. Analysis of electronic medical records from two patient populations. 30,357 individuals with IED and equal number of demographically matched individuals without IED from the TriNetX Research. IED diagnosis identified through the associated ICD codes. The main outcomes were ICD-10-CM diagnostic categories and root codes for disorders and health conditions in both cohorts. Main measures are total numbers and proportions of patients who had the diagnostic codes, as well as adjusted hazard ratios for IED diagnosis. Although only 0.03% of the total patient population had an IED diagnosis, we found extensive and widespread comorbidities with psychiatric, neurological and somatic conditions. A significant 95.7% of the individuals with IED had another psychiatric diagnosis. All psychiatric sub-categories and 95% of the psychiatric diagnoses were significantly associated with IED, with HRs ranging from 2 to 77. Among neurological conditions, neurodegenerative diseases and epilepsy had the highest HRs, followed by extrapyramidal and movement disorders, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes, and sleep disorders.

We estimated the association of the T2D-PRS with cross-sectional and incident DM in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We conducted a mediation analysis with T2D-PRSs as an exposure, incident DM as an outcome, and OSA as a mediator. Additionally, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationship between T2D and OSA. Of 12,342 HCHS/SOL participants, at baseline, 48.4% were normoglycemic, 36.6% were hyperglycemic, and 15% had diabetes, and 50.9% identified as female. Mean age was 41.5, and mean BMI was 29.4. T2D-PRSs was strongly associated with baseline DM and with incident DM. At baseline, a 1 SD increase in the primary T2D-PRS had DM adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.67, 95% CI [2.40; 2.97] and a higher incident DM rate (incident rate ratio (IRR) = 2.02, 95% CI [1.75; 2.33]). In a stratified analysis based on OSA severity categories the associations were stronger in individuals with mild OSA compared to those with moderate to severe OSA. Mediation analysis suggested that OSA mediates the T2D-PRS association with DM. In two-sample MR analysis, T2D-PRS had a causal effect on OSA, OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01; 1.05], and OSA had a causal effect on T2D, with OR = 2.34, 95% CI [1.59; 3.44].

We assessed the ability of plasma proteins to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and related traits. Clinical, genetic, and high-throughput proteomic data from three subcohorts of UK Biobank participants were analyzed for association with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived truncal fat (in the adiposity subcohort), estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) (in the fitness subcohort), and incident T2DM (in the T2DM subcohort). We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to assess the relative ability of non-proteomic and proteomic variables to associate with each trait by comparing variance explained (R2) and area under the curve (AUC) statistics between data types. Stability selection with randomized LASSO regression identified the most robustly associated proteins for each trait. The benefit of proteomic signatures (PSs) over QDiabetes, a T2DM clinical risk score, was evaluated through the derivation of delta (Δ) AUC values. We also assessed the incremental gain in model performance metrics using proteomic datasets with varying numbers of proteins. A series of two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to identify potentially causal proteins for adiposity, fitness, and T2DM. Across all three subcohorts, the mean age was 56.7 years and 54.9% were female. In the T2DM subcohort, 5.8% developed incident T2DM over a median follow-up of 7.6 years. LASSO-derived PSs increased the R2 of truncal fat and VO2max over clinical and genetic factors by 0.074 and 0.057, respectively. We observed a similar improvement in T2DM prediction over the QDiabetes score [Δ AUC: 0.016 (95% CI 0.008, 0.024)] when using a robust PS derived strictly from the T2DM outcome versus a model further augmented with non-overlapping proteins associated with adiposity and fitness. A small number of proteins (29 for truncal adiposity, 18 for VO2max, and 26 for T2DM) identified by stability selection algorithms offered most of the improvement in prediction of each outcome. Filtered and clustered versions of the full proteomic dataset supplied by the UK Biobank (ranging between 600-1,500 proteins) performed comparably to the full dataset for T2DM prediction. Using MR, we identified 4 proteins as potentially causal for adiposity, 1 as potentially causal for fitness, and 4 as potentially causal for T2DM. Plasma PSs modestly improve the prediction of incident T2DM over that possible with clinical and genetic factors. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the clinical utility of these signatures in predicting the risk of T2DM over the standard practice of using the QDiabetes score.

Evidence regarding tibiofemoral OCAT in the setting of concurrent MAT is limited. The purpose of this study was to characterize outcomes for femoral condyle OCAT with concurrent MAT (OCAT+MAT) in the ipsilateral compartment of patients after evidence-based shifts in practice. It was hypothesized that OCAT+MAT would be associated with successful outcomes characterized by statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of knee pain and function in >80% of patients for at least 2 years after transplantation. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. With institutional review board approval and documented informed consent, patients who underwent primary OCAT+MAT between 2016 and 2020 and enrolled in a lifelong registry for prospective collection of outcomes after OCAT were included. Patients with minimum 2-year follow-up data regarding complications, failures, adherence, and PROMs were analyzed.

We aimed to develop and validate predictive models using novel machine learning algorithms for the 3-month mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE) database. Ten machine learning algorithms including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build the models. Performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. Finally, interpretable machine learning (IML) models presenting as Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were applied for mortality risk prediction. A total of 1826 elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis, of whom 624 (34.2%) died, and endovascular treatment was performed in 244 patients. After feature selection, a total of eight variables, including minimum Glasgow Coma Scale values, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, age, alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, platelets, and types of surgery, were finally used for model construction. The AUCs of the CatBoost model were 0.737 in the testing set and 0.709 in the external validation set. The Brier scores in the training set and testing set were 0.12 and 0.21, respectively. The IML of the CatBoost model was performed based on the SHAP value and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations method. The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance for predicting mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU. The IML model would further aid in clinical decision-making and timely healthcare services by the early identification of high-risk patients.","Jian Huang, Xiaozhu Liu, Wanlin Jin","Digital health","2024Jan-Dec",NA

The far-reaching impact of malnutrition affects not only individuals but also their families, communities, and entire nations. By examining underweight, we gain valuable insights into the intricate network of factors influencing child health. Therefore, this study aims to assess underweight prevalence and its associated factors among under-five children in low and lower-middle-income African countries. We conducted a secondary analysis of standard demographic and health surveys in 30 low and lower-middle-income African countries spanning from 2012 to 2022. Our analysis included a total sample of 200,655 children under the age of 5 years. We employed a three-level hierarchical model to assess the determinants of underweight among children in this age group. Measures of association were evaluated using adjusted odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval. Explanatory variables with a p-value less than the level of significance (0.05) were considered statistically significant. The pooled prevalence of underweight among children under the age of five in low and lower-middle income African countries was estimated at 17.60%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 17.44 to 17.77%. The hierarchical analysis identified several factors significantly associated with underweight, including male gender, birth size, maternal body mass index, maternal educational level, household wealth index, antenatal care (ANC) visits, community poverty level, and income level of countries. The high prevalence of underweight among children under the age of five in low and lower-middle income African countries underscores the need for targeted interventions. By addressing individual, community, and country-level factors, we can work toward improving child nutrition and well-being.","Tadesse Tarik Tamir, Alebachew Ferede Zegeye, Belayneh Shetie Workneh, Enyew Getaneh Mekonen","Frontiers in public health","2024","Humans; Thinness; Child, Preschool; Male; Female; Infant; Health Surveys; Africa; Prevalence; Developing Countries; Risk Factors; Infant, Newborn; Socioeconomic Factors; Poverty"

This study compared clinical characteristics between CD patients with CRC from the US and Korean tertiary referral centers and defined the prognostic factors related to mortality. Retrospective study. We reviewed the electronic medical records of 236 adult CD patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Florida, or Arizona (N = 200) and Asan Medical Center in Korea (N = 36) between January 1989 and August 2022. Asan patients had a younger age, shorter CD duration, more colonic involvement (L2 plus L3), penetrating behavior, perianal fistula, and shorter biological treatment duration before CRC diagnosis than Mayo patients. Furthermore, despite significant differences in body mass index, smoking status, primary sclerosing cholangitis, immunomodulators, CRC diagnosis period, clinical presentation, CRC location, surgery, and some histopathological details between the two groups, overall survival was not statistically different (p value, 0.29, log-rank test). Advanced age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.03 per year; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.04; p value, <0.01), unresectable CRC (aHR, 5.02; 95% CI, 2.49-10.12; p value, <0.01), and advanced CRC stage (aHR, 1.45 per stage; 95% CI, 1.07-1.97; p value, 0.02) were significantly associated with increased risk of death. CD remission at CRC diagnosis (aHR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91; p value, 0.04), CRC diagnosis period of 2011-2022 (aHR relative to 1989-2000, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.87; p value, 0.02), and CRC diagnosis by surveillance (aHR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; p value, 0.04) were significantly associated with decreased risk of death. Notably, some clinical features of CD with CRC differed between Asan and Mayo patients; however, overall survival was not different.

"39314636","Association of the systemic inflammation and anthropometric measurements with cancer risk: a prospective study in MJ cohort.","To investigate the specific role of inflammation in the connection between obesity and the overall incidence of cancer. A total of 356,554 participants in MJ cohort study were included. Systemic inflammation markers from blood samples and anthropometric measurements were determined using professional instruments. The Cox model was adopted to evaluate the association. Over a median follow-up of 8.2 years, 9,048 cancer cases were identified. For individual systemic inflammation biomarkers, the overall cancer risk significantly escalated as blood C-reactive protein (CRP) (hazard ratio (HR)=1.036 (1.017-1.054)) and globulin (GLO) (HR=1.128 (1.105-1.152)) levels increased, and as hemoglobin (HEMO) (HR=0.863 (0.842-0.884)), albumin (ALB) (HR=0.846 (0.829-0.863)) and platelets (PLA) (HR=0.842 (0.827-0.858)) levels decreased. For composite indicators, most of them existed a significant relationship to the overall cancer risk. Most indicators were correlated with the overall cancer and obesity-related cancer risk, but there was a reduction of association with non-obesity related cancer risk. Most of indicators mediated the association between anthropometric measurements and overall cancer risk. Systemic inflammatory state was significantly associated with increased risks of cancer risk. Inflammation biomarkers were found to partly mediate the association between obesity and cancer risk.","Zilong Bian, Luopiao Xu, Yuting Wang, Min-Kuang Tsai, David Ta-Wei Chu, Huakang Tu, Chi-Pang Wen, Xifeng Wu","Frontiers in oncology","2024",NA
"39314616","Exploring the Spectrum of Electrolyte Imbalances in Preeclampsia: Mechanisms, Implications, and Clinical Insights.","Preeclampsia, a complex and perplexing disorder unique to pregnancy, is widely recognized as primarily originating from placental dysfunction and can only be resolved by the delivery of the fetus in severe cases. Preeclampsia is a prevalent medical issue during pregnancy and is associated with elevated rates of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. The exact cause of preeclampsia remains uncertain, although multiple factors have been implicated in its development based on current knowledge. Preeclampsia is characterized by maternal endothelial dysfunction due to the presence of fetal-derived circulatory substances from the placenta. The condition is associated with various risk factors, including maternal comorbidities such as chronic renal disease, hypertension (HTN), and obesity. Additionally, a family history of preeclampsia, nulliparity, multiple gestations, previous instances of preeclampsia, or intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) are considered risk factors. Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, play a critical role in the function of vascular smooth muscles and may potentially contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension. In this review, we have summarized the literature on electrolytes in preeclampsia by conducting an extensive systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE).","Aishwarya Gupta, Dharmesh J Patel, Sandhya Pajai","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

We aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of using remdesivir (RDV) with and without tocilizumab (TCZ) and standard therapy in treating severe COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a Jordanian tertiary hospital (September 26th, 2020 - August 28th, 2021) and included adult COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen support. Patients were categorized into three groups based on treatment: TCZ+RDV and standard therapy; RDV and standard therapy; and standard therapy alone, which included dexamethasone, vitamins, anticoagulants, and ceftriaxone. Of 1,556 screened, 1,244 patients (mean age 62.33, 60.8% men) were included. Distribution was 106 in TCZ+RDV, 520 in RDV, and 618 in standard therapy. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, or BMI. Mortality was lowest in TCZ+RDV (32.1%), followed by RDV (40.6%) and standard therapy (47.1%) (p=0.005). Among ICU patients, TCZ+RDV showed significantly lower mortality (51.1%) compared to RDV (75%) and standard therapy (85.8%) (p<0.001). The ICU stays and invasive mandatory ventilation (IMV) durations were significantly shorter with TCZ+RDV (4.30 and 2.69 days, respectively) compared to RDV (7.61 and 4.52 days) and standard therapy (7.98 and 5.32 days) (p<0.001 for ICU stays, p=0.025 for IMV durations).

A focus on physical activity in healthcare services, particularly among healthcare professionals, is crucial. This study aims to explore physical activity levels and influencing factors among physicians in Primary Healthcare Centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving physicians from Primary Healthcare Centers in Makkah. An online questionnaire was used to collect data, which included demographic factors and the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ). Data were analyzed using the SPSS, version 29.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Of the 194 physicians included in the study, 25.3% were found to be inactive, 24.1% moderately inactive, 25.3% moderately active, and 25.3% active. There was no significant association between the Physical Activity Index and age, gender, nationality, income, having children, or job classification. However, marital status, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, and the presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression were significantly associated with the Physical Activity Index (p<0.05). The study provides valuable insights into the physical activity levels among physicians in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.

"39314595","Possible Heterozygous Hypercholesterolemia Among Adults in Basrah, Southern Iraq.","Background Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease and is one of the most prevalent genetic disorders. We aimed to determine the prevalence of patients with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), presumptively indicating possible heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Methods Retrospective data analysis was conducted for adult patients aged 18 and above with fasting LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL registered in Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolism Center (FDEMC) in Basrah for the period from August 2008 to December 2023. The total number of enrolled individuals was 59,026. Results From the data records of the 59,026 individuals enrolled in the study, it was found that 4,093 (6.9 %) had LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL and 361 (0.6 %) had very high total cholesterol according to the Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MEDPED) Criteria. Around 30,527 (51.7 %) were aged 40-59 years, representing the peak age group. Women comprised 34,688 (58.8 %), and 42,310 (71.7 %) had diabetes mellitus. Individuals with obesity comprise 27,375 (48.8 %). Out of the 4,093 patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, 2,422 (59.2 %) were in the 40-59 years age group, and 2,847 (69.6 %) were women. Diabetes was found in 3,442 (84.1 %) patients and obesity in 1,954 (49.9 %) patients. The average blood pressure was higher in the individuals with LDL-C ≥190 (137/83 versus 134/82 respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusions Being one of the largest studies of its kind in the country, the percentage of individuals who might meet the criteria for having possible HeFH in Basrah (Southern Iraq) should raise awareness about the size of the problem in the country, both to encourage family screening programs and to broaden the need for lipid-lowering therapies. Future studies are needed to have further clarifications about the differences in the prevalence between sexes and age groups.

"39314592","Prevalence of Varicose Veins Among Surgeons: A Cross-Sectional Study.","Background Extended periods of standing, obesity, female sex, and older age are risk factors associated with a higher probability of developing varicose veins (VV). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of VV among surgeons in public hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, and to identify the risk factors associated with this condition.  Methodology This is a descriptive cross-sectional study based on a validated online questionnaire distributed via hospital WhatsApp (Meta Platforms Inc., Menlo Park, CA) groups conducted between January and June 2024. The inclusion criteria of this study were surgeons of both sexes and any age group working in the selected hospitals in Makkah City, who agreed to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were any other healthcare workers from outside the surgical field. We included 192 participants, and Epi Info software (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) was used to calculate the sample size. The data were collected, reviewed, and then fed into IBM SPSS Statistics software for Windows version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Every participant filled out a consent form. The university ethics committee of Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, granted ethical permission. Result This study comprised 192 surgeons in Makkah hospitals. Twenty-eight surgeons were either diagnosed with VV or had signs of VV. Varicose veins were detected among 50% of thoracic surgeons, 42.9% of pediatric surgeons, and 26.3% of orthopedic surgeons. The most reported risk factors were a family history of VV (17%), hypertension (16%), and diabetes mellitus (14%). Surgeons aged 40 years or older had a higher prevalence of VV than younger ones. Also, 55.6% of obese surgeons had VV compared to 7.8% of others with average weight. Conclusion We found that VV is a common problem, particularly among individuals with predisposing factors, such as long standing hours, smoking, pregnancy, and obesity. We found that surgeons specializing in thoracic and pediatric specialties and female surgeons were more likely to be affected by VV. Preventive measures, such as avoiding prolonged standing, wearing compression stockings, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, are recommended.","Turki A Qari, Khaled N Almatrafi, Fawaz R Khateb, Bader Al-Kaabi, Ahmed Al-Harbi, Samer Alabdali, Rashed Al-Nemari, Sahar A Bannani","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39314585","An Investigation Into the Risk Factors for Transfusion Need After Neck of Femur Fracture Surgery.","A common surgical procedure in the elderly is the operation on neck of femur fractures, with a primary complication being the need for a postoperative blood transfusion. Consequently, current standard practice involves cross-matching two units of red blood cells for each patient preoperatively. This incurs significant costs and is associated with blood product complications for transfused patients who are at low risk. This study aims to identify factors that could increase the risk of requiring a blood transfusion, thereby facilitating the adaptation of preoperative cross-matching practices to reflect individual patient risks rather than using a generalised approach. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 319 patients from a major acute teaching hospital between June 2023 and January 2024, examining risk factors including preoperative haemoglobin levels, age, gender, type and duration of surgery, type of fracture, BMI, use of anticoagulants, and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, heart disease). Binary logistic regression and odds ratios were used to assess their impact on blood loss and transfusion need. Ninety-nine patients (31%) in our cohort received a blood transfusion. Preoperative haemoglobin (p<0.001) and age (p=0.039) were the only factors found to be significant predictors of the likelihood of needing a blood transfusion. The exponentiation of the B coefficient (Exp(B)) values were 0.920 and 1.040, respectively, indicating a negative correlation for preoperative haemoglobin and a positive correlation for age. Statistical analysis between the group receiving a transfusion versus those who did not showed that patients were significantly older (p<0.001), had lower BMI (p=0.037), and had lower preoperative haemoglobin (p<0.001) in the transfused group. Odds ratios indicated that females (1.34) and patients with hypertension (1.19), cancer (1.09), COPD or asthma (1.06), and heart disease (1.45) were more likely to receive transfusions. Intracapsular fractures (undisplaced 0.12, displaced 0.38) and arthroplasty (0.38) showed lower odds compared to intramedullary (IM) nailing (3.13). The odds ratio changes to less than one for haemoglobin values >110 g/L (<0.7) and increases to values greater than one for age above 80 (>1.27). Increased age and low preoperative haemoglobin significantly raise the risk of hidden blood loss and transfusion need following neck of femur surgery. We suggest further development of a risk prediction model to improve surgical outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimise resource utilisation.","Abdullah Bin Sahl, Emma Biggs, Upamanyu Nath, Abdelwakeel Bakhiet, Tom Collins, Anand Pillai","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

Sixty non-obese patients without metabolic and cardiovascular diseases who were diagnosed with PCOS in the Women and Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January to December 2022 were prospectively selected (case group), and 60 healthy volunteers matched for body mass index were included as the control group. Body weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio were recorded. Fasting blood samples were drawn from the elbow vein to measure hormone levels including total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), lipids, and homocysteine (Hcy). The insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and free androgen index (FAI) were calculated. Ultrasound elastography was used to measure the IMT and elastic function parameters of the right carotid artery, including vessel diameter, wall displacement, stiffness coefficient, and pulse wave velocity. Differences in various parameters between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations between the carotid stiffness coefficient and other serological indicators were assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. No significant differences in age, body mass index, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were observed between the two groups (all P>0.05), while the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was higher in the case group than in the control group (P<0.05).The hormone level serological indicators TT and FAI were higher in the case group than in the control group, and SHBG was lower in the case group than in the control group (all P<0.05). The metabolism-related serum indicators LDL-C, HDL-C, FPG, triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels were not statistically different between the two groups (all P>0.05), and serum FINS, HOMA-IR, and Hcy levels were significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (all P<0.05).No significant difference in carotid artery diameter was observed between the case group and control group (P>0.05). The carotid artery displacement in the case group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (P<0.05), and carotid IMT, hardness coefficient, and pulse wave propagation velocity were greater in the case group than in the control group (all P<0.05). The carotid elastic stiffness coefficient was positively correlated with WHR, TT, SHBG, FAI, FINS, HOMA-IR and Hcy to varying extents and negatively correlated with SHBG. In non-obese PCOS patients with no metabolic or cardiovascular disease, the carotid stiffness coefficient was increased and correlated with indicators of hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and hyperhomocysteinemia.","Yanli Hu, Bo Chen, Yingzheng Pan, Kewei Xing, Zhibo Xiao, Bo Sheng, Jia Li, Hongmei Dong, Furong Lv","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Female; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Adult; Vascular Stiffness; Carotid Arteries; Case-Control Studies; Young Adult; Elasticity; Insulin Resistance; Body Mass Index; Prospective Studies; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Pulse Wave Analysis"

This cross-sectional study was conducted with 765 adolescents aged 12-17 (55.6% girls) in the Valle of Ricote, Murcia, Spain. Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), with validated cut points employed to determine the presence of each of these mental conditions. The perception of barriers to PA was assessed using a validated questionnaire for the Spanish adolescent population. The barrier 'Because I feel that my physical appearance is worse than that of others' was related to a higher likelihood of having depression (OR=2.41; 95% CI 1.35 to 4.28; p=0.003), anxiety (OR=2.65; 95% CI 1.51 to 4.71; p=0.001) and stress (OR=2.82; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.07; p<0.001). Similarly, the barrier 'Because nobody encourages me to engage in physical activity' was related to a higher likelihood of having depression (OR=1.92; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.43; p=0.026), anxiety (OR=1.97; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.50; p=0.021) and stress (OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.59; p=0.021).

This study aimed to assess UPF consumption, its socioeconomic correlates and its association with overweight/obesity amongst under-five children in Lebanon. Data pertinent to children aged 6 months to 4.9 years (n = 893) from a cross-sectional national survey were used. Anthropometric measurements were obtained, and multi-component questionnaires were administered to mothers. Dietary intake was assessed using the 24-h recall approach. NOVA classification was used to assign food items into four groups according to the extent of industrial processing. Contributions of each group to total energy intake (EI) and macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were estimated. Regression models were conducted to explore the correlates of UPF consumption as well as the association between UPF consumption and overweight/obesity status. UPFs were found to contribute 47% of daily EI. Girls and children with higher household income had significantly higher UPF intakes. Children whose mothers had an intermediate, high school, or technical diploma and were employed and whose fathers had higher education levels consumed significantly less EI from UPFs. Children whose %EI fell within the second and third tertiles of UPF intake had significantly higher odds of overweight/obesity as compared to those in the first tertile (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 1.32 and AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.47, 1.76, respectively), after adjusting for confounders.

"39314001","Assessing Equitable Adherence to the Age-Friendly Health System's 4Ms Framework in an Academic Inpatient Setting.","While thousands of health systems have begun to implement the Age-Friendly Health System's 4Ms Framework to improve care for older patients, an important phase of work is achieving consistent adherence to 4Ms care processes. Identifying mechanisms that may lead to higher versus lower adherence serves to guide efforts to achieve consistent, equitable adherence. Drawing from prior literature, we identified three mechanisms that may influence 4Ms adherence. We then conducted a 3-year retrospective, observational study of inpatient encounters (n = 28 833) at UCSF Health System with patients aged 65+. We used least squares regression models to assess associations between hospital encounter-level measures of 4Ms adherence and proxy measures of patient and encounter characteristics for each hypothesized mechanism along with control variables. Encounter-level adherence to the 4Ms was 65.5% (SD = 14.3%). We found support for all three mechanisms. Negative implicit biases were associated with lower adherence for patients who were obese [0.79 percentage points (PP) lower; P < .001] or on Medicaid (0.64 PP lower; P = .002). Positive implicit biases were associated with higher adherence for the oldest old (aged 85+; 2.85 PP higher; P < .001) or with reduced mobility (2.01 PP higher; P < .001). Patients with comprehensive geriatrics care contact (ACE unit and a geriatrics consult) had 5.33 PP higher adherence (P < .001). While most effects were modest in magnitude, our results suggest that both positive and negative implicit biases, as perceived by the provider, may influence the level of 4Ms adherence. Contact with comprehensive geriatrics care appeared most influential. These insights can be leveraged to develop strategies to achieve equitable delivery of 4Ms care.","Julia Adler-Milstein, Robert Thombley, Sarah Rosenthal, Benjamin Rosner, Stephanie Rogers","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing","2024Jan-Dec","Humans; Aged; Retrospective Studies; Female; Male; Inpatients; Aged, 80 and over; United States; Academic Medical Centers; Guideline Adherence"

The highly mutable endocrinopathy, with differential clinical criteria for each diagnosis of PCOS, can mask the severity of the syndrome by influencing the incidence and occurrence of PCOS. When there is a solid theoretical hypothesis between the neuroendocrine origin and ovarian origin of PCOS, recent evidence supports the neuroendocrine derivation of the pathology. It is considered of neuroendocrine basis - as it controls the ovarian axis and acts as a delicate target because it possesses receptors for various gonadal hormones, neurotransmitters & neuropeptides. Can these neuroendocrine alterations, variations in central brain circuits, and neuropeptide dysregulation be the tie that would link the pathophysiology of the disorder, the occurrence of all the 1˚ and 2˚ symptoms like polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, obesity, insulin resistance, etc., in PCOS? This review anticipates providing a comprehensive overview of how neuropeptides such as Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, Dynorphin A, β-Endorphin, Nesfatin, Neuropeptide Y, Phoenixin, Leptin, Ghrelin, Orexin, and Neudesin influence PCOS, the understanding of which may help to establish potential drug candidates against precise targets in these central circuits.","Dheepthi Jayamurali, Nivetha Ravishankar, Nivedita Manoharan, Rajeshwari Parasuraman, Sri Kameshwaran Jayashankar, Sathya Narayanan Govindarajulu","Protein and peptide letters","2024Sep12",NA

This study consecutively enrolled patients diagnosed with severe AS who underwent TAVR in a Chinese tertiary hospital from March 2013 to September 2023. Participants were stratified based on the TyG index cut-off value. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to explore the association between the TyG index and all-cause mortality, including an assessment of interactions between the TyG index and various covariates on mortality outcomes. Among 1045 patients (mean age 74.7 years, 58.2% male), there was 134 all-cause mortality, resulting in a crude mortality rate of 64.3 per 1000 person-years. Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bicuspid aortic valve, atrial fibrillation, Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score, and left ventricular ejection fraction, a per-unit increase in the TyG index was associated with a 41% higher all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03-1.93, p = 0.030). Notably, the relationship between the TyG index and all-cause mortality was significantly modified by age (pinteraction = 0.027), sex (pinteraction = 0.007), hypertension (pinteraction = 0.030), and STS score (pinteraction = 0.002).

"39313824","The Chinese visceral adiposity index: a novel indicator more closely related to cardiovascular disease than other abdominal obesity indices among postmenopausal women.","Several abdominal obesity indices including waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI) were considered effective and useful predictive markers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations or diabetic populations. However, studies investigating the associations between these indices among postmenopausal women are limited. Our study aimed to investigate the associations of the five indices with incident CVD and compare the predictive performance of CVAI with other abdominal obesity indices among postmenopausal women. A total of 1252 postmenopausal women without CVD at baseline were analyzed in our investigation based on a 10-year follow-up prospective cohort study. Link of each abdominal obesity index with CVD were assessed by the Cox regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier curve. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to compare the predictive ability for CVD. During the median follow-up of 120.53 months, 121 participants newly developed CVD. Compared to quartile 1 of LAP and CVAI, quartile 4 had increased risk to develop CVD after fully adjusted among postmenopausal women. When WC, VAI and CVAI considered as continuous variables, significant increased hazard ratios (HRs) for developing CVD were observed. The areas under the curve (AUC) of CVAI (0.632) was greatly higher than other indices (WC: 0.580, WHR: 0.538, LAP: 0.573, VAI: 0.540 respectively). This study suggested that the abdominal obesity indices were associated with the risk of CVD excluded WHR and highlighted that CVAI might be the most valuable abdominal obesity indicator for identifying the high risk of CVD in Chinese postmenopausal women.","Li Liu, Jie Peng, Dejin Zang, Yerui Zhang, Zhenguo Wu, Chunfei Song, Sha Chen, Dachuan Guo, Fanghong Lu, Tengfei Zheng, Jianmin Yang","Journal of translational medicine","2024Sep23","Humans; Female; Postmenopause; Obesity, Abdominal; Cardiovascular Diseases; Middle Aged; Adiposity; Intra-Abdominal Fat; ROC Curve; Asian People; Proportional Hazards Models; Waist-Hip Ratio; Waist Circumference; China; Risk Factors; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Aged; Prospective Studies; East Asian People"
"39313813","Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes in obese patients undergoing Da Vinci robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","The influence of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in obese (OB) and non-obese (NOB) prostate cancer patients remains a topic of debate. The objective of this study was to juxtapose the perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes of RARP in OB and NOB cohorts. We systematically searched the databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library database to identify relevant studies published in English up to September 2023. Review Manager was used to compare various parameters. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023473136). Sixteen comparative trials were included for 8434 obese patients compared with 55,266 non-obese patients. The OB group had a longer operative time (WMD 17.8 min, 95% CI 9.7,25.8; p < 0.0001), a longer length of hospital stay (WMD 0.18 day, 95% CI 0.12,0.24; p < 0.00001, a higher estimated blood loss (WMD 50.6 ml, 95% CI 11.7,89.6; p = 0.01), and higher pelvic lymphadenectomy rate (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04,1.12; p < 0.0001)and lower nerve sparing rate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91,0.99; p < 0.01), but there was no difference between unilateral (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8,1.3; p = 0.8)and bilateral (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.9,1.0; p = 0.06)nerve sparing rate. Then, complication rates (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5,1.7; p < 0.00001) were higher in the OB group, and both major (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1,1.8; p = 0.01)and minor (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1,1.7; p < 0.01)complication rates were higher in the OB group. Moreover, obese patients showed significantly higher probabilities of incontinence (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03,1.33; p = 0.01) and impotency (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01,1.15; p = 0.02) at 1 year. Last, the positive surgical margin (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1,1.3; p < 0.01) was higher in the OB group. In the obese group, perioperative outcomes, total complications, functional outcomes, and oncologic outcomes were all worse for RARP.

"39313801","Study of adiponectin gene (rs1501299) polymorphism and serum adiponectin level in patients with primary knee osteoarthritis.","We aimed to study, for the first time in the Egyptian population, the relationship between the serum adiponectin level in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients and its correlation with clinical, radiological, and ultrasonographic characteristics. Additionally, investigate the relationship between the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene rs1501299 (+ 276G/T) polymorphism and KOA susceptibility and severity. This case-control study enrolled 40 patients with primary KOA and 40 matched controls. All patients underwent physical examination of the knee, pain assessment using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and functional evaluation by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Severity of KOA was assessed by Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grading scale and ultrasonography grading systems. Serum adiponectin levels and adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs1501299) genotyping were done for all patients and controls. The study included 40 patients with primary symptomatic KOA and 40 controls with comparable age, sex, and body mass index. The genotype of the rs1501299 (+ 276G/T) polymorphism of the ADIPOQ gene was determined using TaqMan allelic discrimination. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent test was used to measure the level of serum adiponectin. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) score was used to assess functional capability, while the visual analogue scale was utilised to assess knee pain. Using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading method and global femoral cartilage (GFC) ultrasound grading, the severity of KOA was assessed. No significant differences between patients and controls as regards the genotype distributions and allele frequencies (p = 0.400, p = 0.507, respectively) of ADIPOQ gene rs1501299 (+ 276G/T) polymorphism. Furthermore, serum adiponectin level was significantly higher in the patients compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). Additionally, adiponectin level had a significant negative correlation with disease severity as evaluated by KL and GFC grading (r=-0.351, p = 0.027 and r=-0.397, p = 0.011, respectively). The ADIPOQ gene rs1501299 (+ 276G/T) polymorphism was not associated with KOA severity or vulnerability. The level of adiponectin considerably reduced as the severity of KOA rose, indicating that adiponectin may have a preventive effect in KOA.","Rehab Elnemr, Mowaffak Moustafa Abd El Hamid, Raghda Saad Zaghloul Taleb, Naylan Fayez Wahba Khalil, Sherine Mahmoud El-Sherif","Human genomics","2024Sep23","Humans; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Adiponectin; Male; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Aged; Alleles; Severity of Illness Index; Adult; Gene Frequency; Egypt"
"39313682","The change in lumbar lordosis from the standing to the lateral position: implications for lateral interbody fusion.","The purpose of this cross-sectional, observational study was to establish the relationship between standing lumbar lordosis (LL) and lateral decubitus LL. Forty-nine subjects, 24 male and 25 female, were prospectively enrolled. Patients with pre-existing spinopelvic pathology were excluded. Standing, relaxed-seated, and lateral decubitus lateral radiographs were obtained. Radiographic variables measured included LL and lordosis change at each lumbar level (e.g. L1-L2). The change in LL when going from a standing to a lateral decubitus position (ΔLL), the correlation between standing and sitting LL compared to lateral decubitus LL, and the correlation between ΔLL and standing pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), PI-LL mismatch, pelvic femoral angle (PFA), and sacral slope (SS) were calculated. Subjects had an average age of 25.7 ± 2.3 years and body mass index of 24.1 ± 3.0 kg/m2. On average, 11.9°±8.2° (range - 7° to 29°) of LL was lost when transitioning from a standing to the lateral decubitus position. Lateral decubitus LL had a higher correlation with standing LL (R = 0.725, p < 0.001) than with relaxed-seated LL (R = 0.434, p < 0.001). Standing PT and PI-LL mismatch had moderately negative correlations with ΔLL (R=-0.58 and R=-0.59, respectively, both p < 0.05). Standing PI and standing PFA had a low negative correlation with ΔLL (R=-0.31 and R=-0.44, respectively, both p < 0.05) Standing SS and LL had no correlation with ΔLL. Standing LL was strongly correlated to lateral decubitus LL, although subjects lost an average of 11.9° from the standing to the lateral decubitus position. This has important implications for fusion in the lateral position.","Emily S Mills, Jennifer C Wang, Mary K Richardson, Brian C Chung, Lucas W Mayer, Matthew C Gallo, Ram K Alluri, Raymond J Hah, Nathanael D Heckmann","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society","2024Sep23",NA
"39313572","Early life factors that affect obesity and the need for complex solutions.","The prevalence of obesity increases with age but is apparent even in early life. Early childhood is a critical period for development that is known to influence future health. Even so, the focus on obesity in this phase, and the factors that affect the development of obesity, has only emerged over the past two decades. Furthermore, there is a paucity of iterative work in this area that would move the field forward. Obesity is a complex condition involving the interplay of multiple influences at different levels: the individual and biological level, the sociocultural level, and the environmental and system levels. This Review provides a brief overview of the evidence for these factors with a focus on aspects specific to early life. By spotlighting the complex web of interactions between the broad range of influences, both causal and risk markers, we highlight the complex nature of the condition. Much work in the early life field remains observational and many of the intervention studies are limited by a focus on single influences and a disjointed approach to solutions. Yet the complexity of obesity necessitates coordinated multi-focused solutions and joined-up action across the first 2,000 days from conception, and beyond.","Kylie D Hesketh, Miaobing Zheng, Karen J Campbell","Nature reviews.

"39313571","The multifactorial effect of obesity on the effectiveness and outcomes of cancer therapies.","Epidemiology studies have demonstrated a clear association between obesity and the development of several distinct malignancies, with excessive visceral adiposity being an increasingly prevalent feature in patients with cancer presenting for therapeutic intervention. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have helped to inform effective and safe dosing of traditional systemically administered anticancer agents in adult patients with cancer and obesity, but there remains much debate not only regarding the effect of obesity on the more novel targeted molecular and immune-based therapies, but also about how obesity is best defined and measured clinically. Low muscle mass is associated with poor outcomes in cancer, and body composition studies using biochemical and imaging modalities are helping to fully delineate the importance of both obesity and sarcopenia in clinical outcomes; such studies might also go some way to explaining how obesity can paradoxically be associated with favourable clinical outcomes in certain cancers. As the cancer survivorship period increases and the duration of anticancer treatment lengthens, this Review highlights the challenges facing appropriate treatment selection and emphasizes how a multidisciplinary approach is warranted to manage weight and skeletal muscle loss during and after cancer treatment.","Joanne Lysaght, Melissa J Conroy","Nature reviews.

Seven electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, WANFANG DATA, SinoMed) were searched to collect the literature published since 1999 with the focus on the relationship between body composition measurement indicators and BMI to measure obesity in childhood and adolescence. Among the 28 articles included, 13 articles reported a moderate to very strong correlation between %BF and BMI in obesity measurement (range: 0.49-0.907), while two articles reported a strong to very strong correlation between FM and BMI (range: 0.60-0.86). Six articles reported good to excellent obesity measurement consistency between %BF and BMI (range: 0.441-0.876), one article reported WC (0.58) and WHtR (0.46) in the moderate consistency with BMI, and one article reported a relatively poor to fair consistency between FM and BMI (range: 0.167-0.409). WC, WHtR, and BMI showed the moderate consistency in pre-adolescent children. In pre-adolescence and adolescence, the measurement consistency between %BF and BMI was higher than that between FM and BMI. Gender difference existed in the consistency between %BF and BMI during adolescence. A range of body composition indicators such as %BF, WC, WHtR, and FM could provide valuable body composition measurements, complement BMI for obesity assessment in children and adolescents, and facilitate efficient and comprehensive surveillance of childhood obesity.

Methods: This retrospective observational study included patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥40.0 kg/m2 regardless of other related metabolic diseases and patients with severe type 2 diabetes and a BMI between 27.5 and 40.0 kg/m2. The clinical data of 66 obese patients who underwent SADI-S at the Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Department of China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from November 2018 to May 2022 were collected, including 53 cases of da Vinci robotic surgery and 13 cases of laparoscopic surgery. The patients comprised 38 men and 28 women with a median age of 35 (18-61) years and a mean preoperative BMI of 42.93 ± 6.82 kg/m2. A total of 38 patients had type 2 diabetes, and 46 had hyperuricemia, 45 had hypertension, 35 had hyperlipidemia, 12 had hypercholesterolemia, and 12 had a high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level. The main observation indicators were (1) intraoperative and postoperative conditions; (2) weight loss outcomes, including body weight, BMI, excess body weight loss (%EWL), and total body weight loss (%TWL) at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery; (3) effects of treatment on metabolic disease; and (4) changes in nutrient indicators. Results: (1) Intraoperative and postoperative conditions: All patients successfully underwent SADI-S with neither conversion to laparotomy nor death. Four (6.1%) patients developed postoperative complications, and all of them recovered and were discharged after conservative or surgical treatment. (2) Weight loss outcomes: %EWL at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery was 62.07 ± 26.56, 85.93 ± 27.92, and 106.65 ± 29.65, respectively, and %TWL was 22.67 ± 4.94, 32.10 ± 5.18, and 40.56 ± 7.89, respectively. Body weight and BMI 3 to 12 months after surgery were significantly lower than those before surgery (all P < 0.001). (3) Effect of treatment on metabolic disease: 3 to 12 months after surgery, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, uric acid, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and other indicators were significantly lower than those before surgery (all P < 0.05). Twelve months after surgery, the remission rates of diabetes, hyperuricemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and high LDL were 100% (38/38), 65.2% (30/46), 62.2% (28/45), 94.3% (33/35), 100% (12/12), and 100% (12/12), respectively. (4) Changes in nutrient indicators: Compared with the preoperative nutrient levels, the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were lower at 3 to 12 months after surgery, the total protein level was lower at 6 to 12 months after surgery, the albumin level was lower at 6 months after surgery, and the ferritin level was lower at 3 months after surgery. The differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). The incidence of anemia was 6.1% (4/66), hypoalbuminemia was 4.5% (3/66), and ferritin deficiency was 4.5% (3/66), all of which were improved or normalized through conservative treatment. Twelve months after surgery, 30 (45.5%) patients had vitamin A deficiency, 17 (25.8%) had vitamin E deficiency, 11 (16.7%) had folic acid deficiency, 2 had potassium deficiency (3.0%), 3 (4.5%) had calcium deficiency, 2 (3.0%) had magnesium deficiency, 9 (13.6%) had iron deficiency, and 16 (24.2%) had zinc deficiency. However, no relevant clinical symptoms occurred. Conclusions: SADI-S has a very significant effect on weight loss and alleviation of metabolic diseases. Nutrient deficiencies after SADI-S mainly involve vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, and folic acid.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed relevant clinical data of 66 patients with Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction who had undergone the five-step procedure performed by the same surgeon in the Gastrointestinal Surgery Department of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine from May 2017 to April 2023. The learning curve were plotted using cumulative summation analysis and selected indicators, including intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, time to first flatus, time to first tolerance of liquid food, length of hospital stay, and incidence of perioperative complications at different stages were compared. The data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 statistical software. Numerical data are presented as cases (%) and data were analyzed using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. Normally distributed measurement data are presented as x±s, and independent sample t-testing was performed for inter group comparison. Non-normally distributed measurement data are presented as M(Q1, Q3) and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for inter group comparison. Results: The five-step procedure had been successfully completed without switching to open surgery in all 66 study patients. There were no perioperative deaths, blood loss was 100 (50, 200) mL and duration of surgery 329.4±87.3 minutes. The equation of optimal fit for the duration of surgery was y=0.031x3-4.4757x2+164.97x-264.4 (P<0.001, R2=0.9797). The cumulative summation learning curve reached a vertex when 25 surgical procedures had accumulated. Using 25 cases as the cut-off, we divided the learning curves into learning and proficiency periods and patients into learning (25) and proficiency period groups (41). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients in sex, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, history of abdominal surgery, comorbidities, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, maximum tumor diameter, surgical procedure, or T and N stage of tumor (P>0.05). The following factors differed significantly (all P<0.05) between the learning and proficiency stages: in the latter there was less intraoperative blood loss (100 [50, 100] ml vs. 200 [100, 200] ml, U=-3.940, P<0.001), shorter duration of surgery ([289.8±50.7] minutes vs. [394.4±96.0] minutes, t=5.034, P<0.001), more mediastinal lymph nodes removed (5 [2, 8] vs. 2 [1, 5], U=-2.518, P=0.012), earlier time to first flatus (2 [2, 3] days vs. 4 [3, 6] days, U=-4.016, P<0.001), earlier time to first tolerance of liquid food (5 [4, 6] days vs. 7 [6, 8] days, U=-2.922, P=0.003), shorter duration of hospital stay (8 [8, 10] vs. 10 [9, 12] days, U=-2.028, P=0.043).

Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from a randomized controlled trial (RELARC study) conducted by the colorectal surgery group at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in which laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (CME) was compared with D2 radical resection for the management of right-sided colon cancer. The eligibility criteria were age 18-75 years, biopsy-proven colon adenocarcinoma, tumor located between the cecum and right 1/3 of the transverse colon, enhanced chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scans suggesting tumor stage T2-T4N0M0 or TanyN+ M0, and having undergone radical surgical treatment from January 2016 to December 2019. Exclusion factors included multiple primary colorectal cancers, preoperative stage T1N0 or enlarged central lymph nodes, tumor involving surrounding organs requiring their resection, definite distant metastasis or otherwise unable to undergo R0 resection, history of any other malignant tumors within previous 5 years, intestinal obstruction, perforation, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring emergency surgery, and assessed as unsuitable for laparoscopic surgery. Patients who had participated in the RELARC study were included in the RELARC group, whereas those who met the inclusion criteria but refused to participate in the RELAEC study were included in the control group. The main indicators studied were the patient's baseline data, surgery and perioperative conditions, pathological characteristics, adjuvant treatment, and postoperative follow-up (including average frequency of follow-up within the first 3 years) and survival (including 3-year disease-free survival rate (DFS) and 3-year overall survival rate (OS). Differences in these indicators between the RELARC and control groups were compared. Results: The study cohort comprised 290 patients, 173 in the RELARC group (RELARC-CME group, 82; RELARC-D2 group, 91) and 117 in the control group (CME control group, 72; D2 control group, 45). There was a significantly higher proportion of overweight patients (BMI ≥24 kg/m2) in the RELARC-CME than in the CME control group (67.1% [55/82] vs. 33.3% [24/72], χ2=17.469, P<0.001). There were no other statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics (all P>0.05). No significant disparities were found between the CME and D2 groups in terms of operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, rate of conversion to open surgery, combined organ resection, intraoperative blood transfusion, or intraoperative complications (all P>0.05). There was a trend toward Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher postoperative complications in the RELARC-CME group (24.4% [20/82]) than in the CME control group (18.1% [13/72]); however, this difference was not statistically significant (χ2=0.914, P=0.339). Similarly, the difference in this rate did not differ significantly between the RELARC-D2 group (25.3% [23/91]) and D2 control group (24.4% [11/45], χ2=0.011, P=0.916). The median duration of postoperative follow-up was significantly shorter in the RELARC groups than in the corresponding control groups. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up was 4.5 (4.5, 4.5) months in the RELARC-CME and 7.2 (6.0, 9.0) months in the CME control group (Z=-10.608, P<0.001). Similarly, the median duration of follow-up was 4.5 (4.5, 4.5) months in the RELARC-D2 group as opposed to 8.3 (6.6, 9.0) months in the D2 control group (Z=-10.595, P<0.001). The 3-year DFS rate (91.5%) and OS rate (96.3%) tended to be higher in the RELARC-CME group than in the CME control group (84.7% and 90.3%, respectively). The 3-year DFS rate (87.9%) and OS rate (96.7%) tended to be higher in the RELARC-D2 group than in the D2 control group (81.8% and 88.6%, respectively); however, these differences were not statistically significant (all P>0.05). Subgroup analysis according to pathological stage revealed that patients in the RELARC-D2 group with pN0 stage achieved a significantly superior 3-year OS rate than did those in the D2 control group (100% vs. 88.9%, P=0.008). We identified no statistically significant differences in survival rates between the remaining subgroups (all P>0.05). Conclusions: A high-quality surgical clinical trial with close follow-up can achieve perioperative safety and a trend toward improved survival outcomes.","H Q Zhang, G Q Wang, B Wu, G L Lin, H Z Qiu, B Z Niu, J Y Lu, L Xu, X Y Sun, G N Zhang, Y Xiao","Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery","2024Sep25","Humans; Colonic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Laparoscopy; Prognosis; Adult; Neoplasm Staging; Adenocarcinoma; Colectomy"
"39313412","Relationship between life's essential 8 and the risk of gestational diabetes among us adults.","The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between Life's Essential 8 (LE8) and the risk of gestational diabetes among US adults. We used National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2007-2018 data to perform this study. LE8 scores comprised 4 health behaviors (diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and sleep duration) and 4 health factors (BMI, non-high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Then, LE8 were categorized into low CVH (0 to 49 scores), moderated CVH (50 to 79 scores), and high CVH (80 to 100 scores). Weighted multivariate Logistic regression analysis model were used to estimate the relationship between LE8 and gestational diabetes. A total of 3,189 participants were included, and the portion of gestational diabetes was 15.33%, 11.46%, 7.71% in low CVH, moderate CVH, and high CVH, respectively. Adjustment for covariates, we found that high CVH (OR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.29-0.83, p = 0.01) was associated with decreased of gestational diabetes, not moderate CVH (OR: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.50-1.20, p = 0.25). This inverse associations were dose-response dependent (p-nonlinear = 0.982). This inverse associations were significant in subgroup. Significant interaction between CVH and family diabetes with the risk of gestational diabetes was found (P for interaction = 0.04). High CVH (OR: 0.357, 95%CI: 0.176-0.724, p = 0.005) could significantly decrease the risk of gestational diabetes in the population with family diabetes. The results were generally robust in sensitivity analyses after excluding of ASCVD participants. The high CVH could decrease the risk of gestational diabetes, especially in the population of family diabetes.","Lu Qin, Zhixing Fan, Qian Shi, Hao Hu, Fang Ma, Yanlin Huang, Fengzhi Tan","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians","2024Dec","Humans; Female; Diabetes, Gestational; Pregnancy; Adult; United States; Risk Factors; Nutrition Surveys; Young Adult; Health Behavior; Exercise; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet"

This study investigated the prevalence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GCR) E. coli fecal carriage in children, identified associated risk factors, and determined antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. coli across three regions of Taiwan. Stool samples from children aged 0-18 years were collected in southern, northern, and eastern Taiwan from community or outpatient clinics between July 2022 and May 2023. E. coli colonies were selected and examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and multilocus sequence typing. Participant demographic data and potential risk factors for carrying resistant E. coli were surveyed using a questionnaire. Of the 246 children surveyed, 59.3% carried multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli, and 37.4% carried 3GCR E. coli. The prevalence of 3GCR E. coli carriage was highest in southern Taiwan (42.7%), followed by northern Taiwan (35.5%) and eastern Taiwan (28.4%). The study identified several risk factors which may be associated with the fecal carriage of 3GCR E. coli, such as having lower paternal education levels, being overweight or obese, having a nonvegetarian diet, and consuming eggs, with variations observed across regions. This study documented elevated fecal carriage rates of 3GCR and MDR E. coli across regions of Taiwan. The study also identified numerous demographic and environmental factors that require implementing comprehensive strategies to address this public health challenge.","Wan-Ling Chiang, Hsin Chi, Jia Lu Cheng, Ming-Fang Cheng","Pediatrics and neonatology","2024Aug26",NA

Previous studies assessing the relationship between non-HDL and T2D risk remains inconsistent results. We performed a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate this association. The PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to find articles on ""non-HDL"" and ""T2D"" from inception to December 6, 2023. A random-effects model was used to calculate the effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses and univariate Meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. The main exposure and outcome were non-HDL and T2D, respectively, in the general population. A total of 8 studies included 251,672 participants who met the inclusion criteria for this study. Meta-analysis showed that higher non-HDL increased the risk of T2D compared with the lower non-HDL group (total effect size: 1.16; 95% CI 1.079-1.251, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses and Meta-regression of the association between non-HDL and T2D were not affected by region, proportion of men, sample size, or adjustment for confounders (including BMI, hypertension, waist circumference, and family history of diabetes). Higher non-HDL may be associated with an increased risk of T2D. Large prospective cohort studies are needed to validate these findings, and further studies are required in order to elucidate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the association between non-HDL and T2D.","Mengqi Han, Yue Shen, Xin Guo, Cheng Hong, Xincan Ji, Haoyang Guo, Yuelong Jin, Hui Yuan","Endocrine journal","2024Sep20",NA

We aimed to clarify the clinical features associated with thyroglobulin or thyroperoxidase antibodies (thyroid autoantibodies [Tabs]) in children and young adults with nodules. We performed a cross-sectional study using data from 3,018 participants of 3-29 years of age with nodules, including thyroid cancer, from the Fukushima Health Management Survey. After stratification of the data for body mass index (BMI) and the bilateral width and thickness of the area (BWTAR) as indicators of thyroid volume for age, sex, body surface area (BSA), and sex-adjusted standard deviation score (SDS), trend analyses were performed. A logistic regression analysis was performed using tab-positivity as an objective variable. The overall prevalence of tab-positivity is 13.9%. It was high in females (17%), participants with diffuse goiter (DG) (19.2%), and those with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (12.8%). The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for BMI-SDS, BWTAR-SDS, presence of DG, diagnosis of PTC, and TSH concentrations were 0.962 (0.863-1.073), 1.263 (1.171-1.361), 7.357 (4.816-11.239), 2.787 (1.965-4.014), and 1.403 (1.257-1.564), respectively. Tab positivity was independently associated with a large thyroid, the presence of DG, the presence of PTC, and a high TSH concentration in patients with nodules.

This cluster-randomized controlled trial enrolled 19 primary care teams with 63 clinicians; 9 teams were randomized to GEM and 10 to enhanced usual care (EUC). The GEM intervention included 1 in-person and up to 12 telephone-delivered coaching sessions. Coaches supported goal setting and engagement with weight management programs, facilitated by a software tool. Patients in the EUC arm received educational handouts. We enrolled patients who spoke English or Spanish, were aged 18 to 69 years, and either were overweight (body mass index 25-29 kg/m2) with a weight-related comorbidity or had obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). The primary outcome (weight change at 12 months) and exploratory outcomes (eg, program attendance, diet, physical activity) were analyzed according to intention to treat. We enrolled 489 patients (220 in the GEM arm, 269 in the EUC arm). Their mean (SD) age was 49.8 (12.1) years; 44% were male, 41% Hispanic, and 44% non-Hispanic Black. At 12 months, the mean adjusted weight change (standard error) was -1.4 (0.8) kg in the GEM arm vs -0.8 (1.6) kg in the EUC arm, a nonsignificant difference (P = .48). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed that the GEM arm had a greater change than the EUC arm in mean number of weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity other than walking, a finding that may warrant further exploration. The GEM intervention did not achieve clinically important weight loss in primary care.

This was a national, multicentre, prospective, non-interventional cohort study (SIOI). Among the 35 patients with histologically proven orbital inflammation who had previously been studied for their IgG4 immunostaining status, we selected those with a negative IgG4 status (ie, pIOIS) who received corticosteroids as single first-line treatment. Clinical, morphological and pathological findings at diagnosis and during follow-up from treatment initiation to study completion were analysed. Patients were assessed for their response to prednisone after the 24-month prospective phase in terms of remission (≤10 mg/d) or failure (>10 mg/d). Daily standard doses of prednisone (DSDP) were calculated at different time-points and compared between response groups. Of the 17 patients with pIOIS included in the final analysis, two-thirds received corticosteroids only. DSDP (mg/kg-day) were significantly higher at the time of failure in eight patients (47%) than in nine (53%) remitting at M24 (0.16 vs 0.045; p: 0.03). Notably, patients with pIOIS with a cellular pattern or orbital fat involvement tended to receive higher daily corticosteroid doses in the event of failure than remission (0.16 vs 0.045 and 0.12 vs 0.042, respectively). During treatment, maximal DSDP was 0.52 in failed patients. The highest corticosteroid doses were insufficient to prevent failure in patients with pIOIS, particularly in those with a cellular pattern or orbital fat involvement.

We sought to explore shared genetic predisposition across the phenome and to assess risk stratification in individuals genetically similar to European, African and Admixed-American reference samples. A 44-variant PRS was applied to the All of Us Research Program. Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) identified conditions linked with heightened genetic susceptibility to diverticular disease. To evaluate the PRS in risk stratification, logistic regression models for symptomatic and for severe diverticulitis were compared with base models with covariates of age, sex, body mass index, smoking and principal components. Performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and Nagelkerke's R2. The cohort comprised 181 719 individuals for PheWAS and 50 037 for risk modelling. PheWAS identified associations with diverticular disease, connective tissue disease and hernias. Across ancestry groups, one SD PRS increase was consistently associated with greater odds of severe (range of ORs (95% CI) 1.60 (1.27 to 2.02) to 1.86 (1.42 to 2.42)) and of symptomatic diverticulitis ((95% CI) 1.27 (1.10 to 1.46) to 1.66 (1.55 to 1.79)) relative to controls. European models achieved the highest AUROC and Nagelkerke's R2 (AUROC (95% CI) 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81); R2 0.25). The PRS provided a maximum R2 increase of 0.034 and modest AUROC improvement. Associations between a diverticular disease PRS and severe presentations persisted in diverse cohorts when controlling for known risk factors.

Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an established measure of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular health and is validated in pregnancy. Our objective was to examine the obesity-related changes in PWV in pregnant individuals with and without HDP. Eighty-seven individuals with singleton pregnancies were recruited and classified into two groups: cases (HDP: including pre-existing/chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); n = 39) and normotensive controls (no HDP or IUGR; n = 48). Patient data, including body mass index (BMI), were collected from patient charts. Measurements of PWV were performed weekly until discharge or delivery (gestational age 24-37 weeks) and placental growth factor (PlGF) was measured at routine blood draws. PWV did not significantly change over gestation for either group. Cases had significantly increased PWV and decreased PlGF compared to normotensive controls. An elevated BMI was associated with higher PWV in both cases and controls. Once grouped based on BMI, PWV was only significantly higher in cases with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 compared to controls, whereas PlGF was less affected by BMI. As PWV increased, PlGF decreased; however, after controlling for BMI, there was no relationship between PWV and PlGF. PWV measurements in early pregnancy may be useful as an additional independent marker to PlGF for risk-stratifying for HDP, especially in individuals with increased BMI.","Genevieve Eastabrook, Erin Murray, Samantha Bedell, Michael R Miller, Samuel Siu, Barbra de Vrijer","Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC","2024Sep21",NA

Although obesity is a known risk factor for CVDs, the relative contributions of overall versus abdominal obesity are less clear. We aimed to estimate the 10-year CVD risks of the Indonesian population and investigate the separate and joint associations of overall and abdominal obesity with these risks. Using nationally representative data from the Indonesian Health Survey (n = 33,786), the 10-year CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham Score. The score was calculated as %-risk, with >20% indicating high risk. Overall obesity was measured by BMI, while abdominal obesity was measured by waist circumference. We performed sex-stratified multivariable linear regressions to examine the associations of standardized units of BMI and waist circumference with the 10-year CVD risk, mutually adjusted for waist circumference and BMI. Mean (SD) 10-year CVD risks were 14.3(8.9)% in men and 8.0(9.3)% in women, with 37.3% of men and 14.1% of women having high (>20%) risks. After mutual adjustment, one SD in BMI and waist circumference were associated with 0.75(0.50-1.01) and 0.95(0.72-1.18) increase in the %-risk of CVD in men, whereas in women, the β(95% CIs) were 0.43(0.25-0.61) and 1.06(0.87-1.26). Abdominal fat accumulation showed stronger associations with 10-year CVD risks than overall adiposity, particularly in women. Although men had higher overall CVD risks, women experienced more detrimental cardiovascular effects of obesity.

An observational cohort study was conducted to measure DM using ultrasound both at rest (DMrest) and during deep inspiration (DMmax). Forty-nine patients with stable COPD were included in this study. There was a correlation between DMmax and FEV1 %predicted (R = 0.36; P = .012), RV %predicted (r = -0.42; P = .01), RV/total lung capacity (r = -0.61; P < .001), and distance reached in the 6MWT (R = 0.46; P = .001). Patients with a modified Medical Research Council score <2 exhibited greater DM than those with a score ≥2 (mean difference = 13.20 ± 4.6 mm; P = .0059). Similarly, patients with a Body Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise Capacity index ≤4 showed greater DM (61.95 mm) than those with a Body Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea and Exercise Capacity index >4 (47.89 mm; mean difference = 14.05 ± 5.3 mm; 95% confidence interval = 25.09-3.01 mm). DM is correlated with bronchial obstruction (FEV1), lung hyperinflation (RV and RV/total lung capacity), exercise capacity, and dyspnea in patients with COPD, suggesting its utility as an evaluative tool in this population.","Bianca Carmo Figueira Silva, Diego Condesso Abreu, Yves Raphael Souza, Manoele Figueiredo, Joseane Felix Macêdo, Thiago Thomaz Mafort, Rogerio Rufino, Claudia Henrique da Costa","Medicine","2024Sep20","Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Male; Female; Diaphragm; Ultrasonography; Aged; Middle Aged; Dyspnea; Forced Expiratory Volume; Walk Test; Exercise Tolerance; Severity of Illness Index"
"39312311","Influencing factors of glycemic control in singleton pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus in western China: A retrospective study.","To investigate the factors influencing glycemic control in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients and their impacts on pregnancy outcomes, providing insights for GDM management. Pregnant women diagnosed with GDM at a tertiary hospital in western China in 2019. Participants were categorized based on varying levels of glycemic control during pregnancy. A retrospective analysis was conducted, utilizing univariate and multivariate regression analyses, to identify factors influencing glycemic control in GDM patients. Based on various approaches to manage glucose, subjects were categorized into A1 (diet and exercise guidance alone) and A2 (insulin usage) groups. Based on whether glucose levels met the glycemic target in women with GDM, subjects were further divided into satisfactory and unsatisfactory groups. A total of 2621 women meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Independent factors associated with GDM A2 included higher prepregnancy body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.070, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.019-1.122, P = .006), a history of GDM (OR = 1.888, 95% CI: 1.052-3.389, P = .033), elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in early pregnancy (OR = 1.828, 95% CI: 1.320-2.532, P < .001), elevated 1-hour postprandial glucose (1-h PG) (OR = 1.126, 95% CI: 1.0091.256, P = .034), and 2-h PG by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (OR = 1.181, 95% CI: 1.046-1.333, P = .007). Higher FPG by OGTT was an independent risk factor for unsatisfactory glycemic control (OR = 1.590, 95% CI: 1.273-1.985, P < .001). Compared with the A1 group, the A2 group has longer hospitalization, higher rates of cesarean section, placenta previa, and neonatal pneumonia (P < .05). Compared with the satisfactory group, the unsatisfactory group has lower gestational age, lower rates of cesarean section and placenta previa, and higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage for mothers; lower length and weight, and higher rates of premature birth, jaundice, hypoglycemia, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, hospitalization, and hospitalization for more than 15 days in both pediatric unit and neonatal intensive care unit for newborns (P < .05). Elevated prepregnancy body mass index, FPG in early pregnancy, 1-h and 2-h PG during OGTT, and with a history with GDM are independent factors influencing insulin utilization, while elevated 0-h PG is an independent influencing factor of unsatisfactory glycemic control. Poor glycemic control has negative impacts on both maternal and fetal outcomes under 2 classifications.","Jiani Zhang, Chihui Mao, Qi Cao, Guiqiong Huang, Xiaodong Wang","Medicine","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Diabetes, Gestational; Retrospective Studies; Adult; China; Glycemic Control; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Pregnancy Outcome; Insulin; Glucose Tolerance Test; Risk Factors"

This prospective observational study was conducted at the Antalya Training and Research Hospital Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic, Türkiye, between July and December 2023. Forty women diagnosed with HEG and 40 healthy women were included. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of sociodemographic data such as age, body mass index, family history, educational status, economic level, place of residence, occupation, smoking and alcohol use, or drug habits. However, obstetric characteristics such as number of miscarriages, number of dilatation curettages, and gestational age and laboratory values including complete blood count, hematocrit, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, free T4, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, hs-C-reactive protein, and sodium (P > .05) all differed significantly. In addition, significant differences were observed between the HEG and healthy groups in terms of numbers of gravidities (2 [1-3] vs 1 [0-1], respectively, P < .001), numbers of parities (1 [0-1] vs 1 [0-1], P < .001), numbers of living children (1 [0-2] vs 1 [0-1], P < .001), presenting complaints (nausea 0 [0%], nausea + vomiting 0 [0%], none 40 [100.0%] vs nausea 27 [67.5%], nausea + vomiting 13 [32.5%], none 0 [0%], P < .001), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (1.16 ± 0.56 vs 1.81 ± 0.624, P = .004), potassium (4.1 ± 0.7 vs 3.8 ± 0.2, P = .001), and AA values (7.29 ± 2.61 vs 10.74 ± 3.04, P < .001).

Using the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2021, we estimated incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the ratio of years lived with disability (YLD) to DALYs for ADOD in China. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to quantify the temporal trends from 1990 to 2021. In 2021, China experienced the highest ADOD burden among Group of 20 member nations. The EAPCs for age-standardized rates for incidence, age-standardized rates for prevalence, and age-standardized mortality rate were 0.41 (uncertainty intervals [UIs] 0.34-0.49); 0.44 (UI: 0.36-0.52); and -0.19 (UI: -0.23 to -0.15), respectively. Between 1990 and 2021, the number of people with ADOD increased by 322.18% and DALYs associated with ADOD increased by 272.71%; most of these increases were explained by population aging. Considering the aging Chinese population, targeted strategies to prevent dementia are urgently needed. China experienced the highest dementia burden among Group of 20 member nations. High body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and smoking were major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (ADOD) burden. Since 1990, the incidence and prevalence of ADOD increased substantially in China. The mortality rate related to ADOD decreased consistently.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the safety and efficacy profile of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, and Licogliflozin) for the treatment of women suffering from PCOS. A literature search in PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted for randomized clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors in PCOS patients by applying predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The articles in English language were included. Four randomized controlled trials including 146 subjects were included in the review. The clinical studies indicated a significant decrease in the levels of total testosterone, free androgen index, total body fat, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body mass index (BMI), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). However, no significant difference was reported in levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Overall, there was improvement in metabolic and endocrine profiles, suggesting a potentially beneficial impact of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of PCOS.

The invasiveness of surgical approaches plays a relevant role in HO development. The aims of this study were to assess the development of HO 6 months after THA through direct lateral approach (DLA) or direct anterior approach (DAA) without a dedicated orthopaedic table and to assess the clinical impact of HO. This is a single-center IRB-approved, quasi-randomized prospective cohort, observational imaging study. Fifty patients underwent primary THA through DLA and 50 through DAA. Age, sex, BMI and side of the affected hip were collected. At the 6 post-operative month the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the presence of HO (scored through the Brooker classification system) were assessed. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between groups. Operative time was significantly higher in the DAA group (72 ± 10 min vs. 58 ± 8 min: p < 0.03). At 6 post-operative months the incidence of HO was 14% in the DAA group and 32% in the DLA group (p = 0.02). Severe HO (Brooker 3-4) were significantly more common in the DLA group (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the HHS of patients with HO between the DAA and DLA groups. There was no association between poorer clinical outcomes and the severity of HO. The DAA without a dedicated orthopaedic table is associated with a significant lower incidence of HO than the DLA 6 months after elective THA. Except for the surgical approach, no other factors correlated with the occurrence of HO. Even though a lower HHS was found with severe HO, the correlation between severity of HO and clinical outcomes did not reach statistical significance.","Raffaele Iorio, Matteo Romano Cantagalli, Edoardo Viglietta, Federico Corsetti, Yuri Gugliotta, Leonardo Previ, Salvatore Gagliardo, Simone Fenucci, Nicola Maffulli","Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery","2024Sep23",NA
"39311895","National introduction of one-anastomosis gastric bypass in the UK National Bariatric Surgery Registry - a cohort study.","There is a paucity of evidence regarding the national introduction of newer bariatric metabolic surgery procedures. This study assessed the impact of introducing one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) in bariatric surgical practice in the UK on 30-day postoperative morbidity and early postoperative weight loss. Patients who underwent primary BMS in the UK National Bariatric Surgical Registry (2010-2019) were identified. Patient characteristics, 30-day postoperative morbidity, and 12-month total body weight loss (TBWL) were also assessed. Multivariate regression was performed for associations between 30-day postoperative morbidity and 12-month TBWL, with SG as a reference. Learning effects were assessed by factoring in the institutional OAGB caseload (0-24/25-49/50+ cases). A total of 59,226 patients underwent primary BMS during the study period (RYGB, 38,434; SG, 24,702; AGB, 12,627; OAGB, 3,408; and Others, 276). The 30-day postoperative morbidity was lower for OAGB 1.8% (51/2,802) compared to RYGB 4.2% (1,391/32,853) and SG 3.4% (725/21,333) but higher than AGB 1.2% (123/9,915), while on multivariate regression, OAGB was associated with reduced morbidity once the institution caseload exceeded 50 operations (OR 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22-0.56; P<0.001) and no statistical difference to SG at lesser caseloads. Overall, 12-month greater than 25% TBWL was seen in 69.4% (27736/39971) (RYGB: 82.9% (17617/21246)), SG: 65.4% (7383/11283)), AGB: 23.9% (1382/5572)) and OAGB: 82.9% (1328/1601)). On multivariate regression, OAGB was associated with the highest 12-month TBWL once the institution caseload exceeded 50 operations (OR 3.47 (95% CI 2.75-4.39; P<0.001).

"39311815","Associations of disordered eating and unhealthy weight control behaviors with cardiovascular health: The coronary artery risk development in young adults study.","Few studies have investigated disordered eating and unhealthy weight control behaviors and cardiovascular health (CVH) outside of adolescence and early adulthood. We examined the cross-sectional and prospective associations of these behaviors and CVH in middle adulthood. A total of 2,095 Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults participants were assessed at Year 10 (Y10, 1995-1996) and Year 30 (Y30, 2015-2016). The Y10-administered Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-Revised was used to create the problematic relationship to eating and food (PREF) score (range 0-8). Higher scores indicated greater disordered eating and/or unhealthy weight control behaviors across eight components. PREF was modeled categorically: 0-1 (reference), 2-3, and 4-8. Diet, physical activity, smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and body mass index (BMI) were measured at Y10 and Y30 (diet at Y7 and Y20) and used to define CVH. CVH was modeled categorically: poor-to-intermediate (0-9) and ideal (10-14; reference). Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between PREF and CVH categories and components. PREF 4-8 was associated with Y10 poor-to-intermediate CVH (OR = 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.78, 3.10]) but not Y30 (OR = 1.34, 95% CI [0.96, 1.87]) compared to PREF 0-1. PREF 2-3 was not associated with Y10 or Y30 CVH. Individual PREF components were not uniformly associated with individual CVH components, although all PREF components were associated with Y10 poor-to-intermediate BMI. Disordered eating and unhealthy weight control behaviors are cross-sectionally but not prospectively associated with poorer CVH during middle age.

We used multivariable linear regression analyses with cross-sectional data from 797 African American midlife adults in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland, to examine the interactive relations of both linear and quadratic discrimination, religious affiliation status, and sex with PWV in models adjusted for age and poverty status. Findings revealed a significant three-way interaction of Discrimination² × Religious Affiliation Status × Sex with PWV (B = 0.004, SE = 0.001, p = .004). Simple effect analyses showed a U-shape relation for only religiously affiliated men (B = 0.001, SE = 0.001, p = .008). Both lower and higher levels of discrimination were related to higher PWV. No such relations emerged among unaffiliated men or women. Findings remained robust after sensitivity analyses adjusted for depressive symptoms, cigarette use, obesity, marital status, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, CVD medical history, cholesterol, lipid-lowering medication use, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Religiously affiliated African American men who reported the lowest and highest experienced discrimination showed a heightened risk for subclinical CVD. Having a religious identity might either play a role in suppressing men's unwanted memories of discrimination or increase men's susceptibility to and salience of mistreatment, which might manifest in adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.

"39311791","Association between triglyceride-glucose index and arterial stiffness progression: A retrospective cohort study.","Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is an effective indicator for assessing IR. This study aims to explore the relationship between the TyG index and the risk of arterial stiffness progression. This retrospective cohort study included adults who had undergone at least 2 health examinations with arteriosclerosis testing at the Health Management Medical Center of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, between January 2012 and December 2022. Clinical data were collected. The TyG index was calculated using the formula of ln (triglycerides×fasting blood glucose/2). The baseline TyG index was assessed as both a continuous variable and as a quartile-based categorical variable. The progression of arteriosclerosis was evaluated by the annual change rate of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and the new onset of increased arterial stiffness. Linear regression model and Cox proportional hazard model were used to explore whether the TyG index is an independent risk factor for arterial stiffness progression. Subgroup analyses were performed based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and the presence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia to determine the characteristics of the association between the TyG index and arterial stiffness progression. A total of 4 971 participants were included, with a follow-up period of (3.01±1.98) years. During follow-up, the annual baPWV change rate was (24.94±81.15) cm/s, and 278 cases of new onset of increased aterial stiffness were recorded. After fully adjusting for confounding factors, the baseline TyG index was independently positively correlated with both the annual baPWV change rate (β=17.5, 95% CI 9.00 to 25.94, P<0.001) and the risk of new onset of increased aterial stiffness [hazard ratio (HR)=1.43, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.74, P<0.001] when the TyG index was treated as a continuous variable. When treated as a categorical variable, higher TyG index quartiles were associated with progressively higher baPWV change rates and new onset of increased arterial stiffness (all P<0.05). In subgroups of participants aged ≥45 years, males, BMI<28 kg/m2, those with or without hypertension, and those without type 2 diabetes or hyperlipidemia, the baseline TyG index (both continuous and categorical) was significantly associated with new onset of increased arterial stiffness (all P<0.05), with no significant interactions observed across subgroups (all P>0.05). The TyG index is independently associated with an increased risk of arterial stiffness progression and may serve as a useful indicator for assessing arterial stiffness progression risk in health check-up populations.","Xiaoling Zhu, Jia Chen, Xuelian Liu, Yaqin Wang","Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Patients and Method: A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted using convenience sampling from eight selected counties/cities in Zhejiang, China, between May 2021 and September 2022. Demographics, epidemiological, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics were obtained from a questionnaire. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-logistic regression analysis was used to identify the variables associated with NAFLD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to evaluate the diagnostic value and clinical utility of the variables and models. Results: A total of 1739 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, 345 (19.8%) were non-overweight/obese and 1394 (80.2%) were overweight/obese participants. There were 114 (33.0%) and 1094 (78.5%) patients who met the criteria for NAFLD in the non-overweight/obese participants and the overweight/obese participants respectively. Older age, current smoking, higher triglyceride (TG) levels, higher AST levels, higher albumin levels, lower insulin levels, and higher controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores were associated with NAFLD in both non-overweight/obese and overweight/obese participants. The combination of TG+CAP scores had strong predictive values for NAFLD, especially in non-overweight/obese (Area Under Curve = 0.812, 95% confidence interval: 0.764-0.863). DCA showed a superior net benefit of the TG+CAP score over other variables or models, suggesting a better clinical utility in identifying NAFLD. Conclusions: More stringent lipid management strategies remain essential, and the convenience and efficacy of transient elastography for liver steatosis should be recognized, especially in the non-overweight/obese population.","Yang Zheng, Yujing Sun, Wen Ren, Ruoshu Duan, Shuai Li, Mingmin Chen, Hongli Qin, Meike Ying, Jingjing Ren","Metabolic syndrome and related disorders","2024Sep23",NA

However, the relationship between diet and the prevalence of central obesity among rural and urban communities remains unclear in low- and middle-income countries. Aim: This study aimed to analyze the association of food consumption with central obesity among middle-aged adults (45-59 years) in urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using secondary data from a national survey (Indonesia Basic Health Survey) in Indonesia in 2018. A total of 154,449 subjects were analyzed for the study. We used the International Diabetes Federation to define central obesity. Food consumption was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between food consumption and central obesity. Results: Frequent consumption of refined desserts, fried food, processed food, and inadequate consumption of fruit was significantly associated with central obesity in urban and rural areas (p < 0.05). In contrast, frequent consumption of seasoning and inadequate consumption of vegetables was significantly associated with central obesity only in rural areas (p < 0.05).

Despite its potential for cardiovascular protection, the role of vitamin C (VTMC) in stroke risk remains contentious. Aim: This study aimed to assess VTMC deficiency in stroke patients and its association with stroke risk. Methods: We analyzed data from 13,339 adults aged 20 and above in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2003 and 2018, excluding those with missing serum VTMC and stroke status. We assessed the VTMC deficiency (<11.4 µmol/L) and stroke incidence association using multivariate weighted logistic regression, adjusting for demographics, BMI, medical history, smoking, and dietary VTMC intake. Results: Stroke rates in the NHANES cycles 2003-2006 and 2017-2018 were 2.8% (95% CI [2.3-3.4]) and 3.3% (95% CI [2.7-4.2]), respectively. VTMC deficiency was more common in individuals with a history of stroke, with rates of 3.6% (95% CI [2.2-5.8]) and 5.3% (95% CI [3-9.1]) compared to 2.7% (95% CI [2.3-3.3]) and 3.2% (95% CI [2.5-4.1]) in the nonstroke population. Nevertheless, VTMC deficiency was distinctly prevalent across diverse demographic and health-related subgroups. Multivariate analyses invalidated any statistically significant association between VTMC deficiency and stroke risk across all employed analytical models within both time intervals. Conclusions: Our study does not support a link between VTMC deficiency and increased stroke risk in U.S. adults. Substantial uncertainties persist regarding the use of VTMC for stroke-related oxidative stress, dosage, and delivery methods, requiring further clinical trials. Healthcare providers should carefully consider its prevalence in specific subgroups.","Tran Quang Duc, Nguyen Thi Nu, Nguyen Di Khanh, Dao Huy Cu, Vu Thi Quynh Chi, Tran Thi Khuyen, Nguyen Thi Hoa Huyen","Nutrition and health","2024Sep23",NA

"39311649","Free-fatty acid receptor-4 gene polymorphism (rs61866610) and colorectal cancer risk.","This study aimed to investigate the impact of Free-fatty acid receptor-4 (FFAR4) rs61866610 polymorphism on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Herein, ninety-two histopathologically confirmed CRC patients and 95 healthy individuals were evaluated for FFAR4 polymorphism by RFLP-PCR. Gender, age, body mass index (BMI), underlying disease, and smoking status were recorded for all subjects. Clinical and histopathologic findings including tumor grade and TNM stage were also prepared in the patient group. Except for type 2 diabetes which was more prevalent in the control group, there were no differences between the two groups regarding underlying diseases (p > 0.05). The frequency of genotypes was as follows: in the CRC group 75% wild type, 23.9% heterozygous, and 1.1% homozygous mutant. In the control group 85.3% wild type, 12.6% heterozygous, and 2.1% homozygous mutant. Mutant allele carriers were more frequent in CRC subjects (25%) than in the normal group (14.7%) but it did not reach a significant level. The frequency of mutant genotypes in colon cancer and rectal cancer was 27.5% and 8.3% respectively (p = 0.282). The mutant genotypes were found more in patients with high-grade tumors (p = 0.154). Subjects with stage III/IV had a higher frequency of mutant genotypes than low-stage cases (p = 0.011). No association was found regarding rs61866610 and obesity or type 2 diabetes (p > 0.05). In conclusion, FFAR4 (rs61866610) has no significant association with the risk of CRC, but the higher frequency of mutant genotypes in subjects with advanced cancer stages (III/IV) suggests further studies to determine the role of FFAR4 in colorectal tumorigenesis.","Ramin Shekarriz, Maryam Hasanian, Mohadeseh Ahmadi, Versa Omrani-Nava, Reza Alizadeh-Navaei","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids","2024Sep23",NA
"39311554","The Effect of Dietary Acid Load on Cardiometabolic Risk, Psychological Resilience and Sleep Quality in Adolescents with Obesity.","Mild metabolic acidosis may adversely affect cardiovascular risk factors, and diet-dependent acid-base load may impair mental health and sleep quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary acid load on cardiometabolic risk factors, psychological resilience, and sleep quality in adolescents with obesity. 205 adolescents with obesity (105 males, 100 females) aged 13-18 years participated in the study. Participants' biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements and blood pressures were measured. Three-day retrospective food intake records were collected from the adolescents, and potential renal acid load (PRAL), net endogenous acid production (NEAP), and dietary acid load (DAL) were derived from food intake records. Psychological resilience levels of adolescents were assessed by the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-12) and sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). It was found that BMI, fat mass, fat percentage, fasting insulin, triglyceride, systolic blood pressure, HOMA-IR and PSQI scores were significantly higher and psychological resilience levels were significantly lower in high tertiles of dietary acid load (p<0.05). Adolescents in the lowest tertile of dietary acid load scores had higher consumption of whole grains, vegetables, dairies, legumes, and higher intakes of potassium and calcium than adolescents in the highest tertile of the dietary acid load scores (p<0.05). Red meat, white meat consumption and sodium intake were higher in adolescents in the high tertiles (p<0.05). Energy intakes were found to be significantly lower in the first tertile of PRAL and DAL scores compared to the other tertiles (p<0.05). According to the linear regression model, an increase in NEAP, PRAL and DAL scores leads to a decrease in psychological resilience score and an increase in PSQI and HOMA-IR scores (p<0.05). High dietary acid load is associated with high cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance, and low psychological resilience and poor sleep quality.","Rukiye Bozbulut, Esra Döğer, Mahmut Orhun Çamurdan, Aysun Bideci","Journal of clinical research in pediatric endocrinology","2024Sep23",NA
"39311500","Comparison of the Therapeutic Efficacy and Autophagy-Mediated Mechanisms of Action of Urine-Derived and Adipose-Derived Stem Cells in Osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and disabling disease that affects a significant proportion of the global population. Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) have shown great prospects in the treatment of OA, but there is no study that has compared them with traditional stem cells. This study aimed to compare the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of USCs and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for OA treatment. Controlled laboratory study. We compared the biological properties of USCs and ADSCs using CCK-8, colony formation, EdU, adhesion, and apoptosis assays. We evaluated the protective effects of USCs and ADSCs on IL-1β-treated OA chondrocytes by chemical staining, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. We assessed the effects of USCs and ADSCs on chondrocyte autophagy by transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. We also compared the therapeutic efficacy of intra-articular injections of USCs and ADSCs by gross, histological, micro-computed tomography, and immunohistochemical analyses in an OA rat model induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection. USCs showed higher proliferation, colony formation, DNA synthesis, adhesion, and anti-apoptotic abilities than ADSCs. Both USCs and ADSCs increased the expression of cartilage-specific proteins and decreased the expression of matrix degradation-related proteins and inflammatory factors in OA chondrocytes. USCs had a greater advantage in suppressing MMP-13 and inflammatory factors than ADSCs. Both USCs and ADSCs enhanced autophagy in OA chondrocytes, with USCs being more effective than ADSCs. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA reduced the enhanced autophagy and protective effects of USCs and ADSCs on OA chondrocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the efficacy of USCs in the treatment of knee OA and to compare them with ADSCs. Considering the superior properties of USCs in terms of noninvasive acquisition, a high cost-benefit ratio, and low ethical concerns, our study suggests that they may be a more promising therapeutic option than ADSCs for OA treatment under rigorous regulatory pathways. USCs may be a superior cell source for stem cells to treat knee OA, and this study strengthens the evidence for the application of USCs.","Tianhao Xu, Kaibo Zhang, Yunan Hu, Runze Yang, Jiexi Tang, Weili Fu","The American journal of sports medicine","2024Sep23",NA
"39311418","Cell salvage techniques and obstetric haemorrhage.","Over the last decade, the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage has risen because of increasing maternal age at time of delivery, multiple births, obesity and increased obstetric interventions, resulting in most of these women requiring blood transfusions. While lifesaving, blood transfusion is not without risk. Recipients may rarely develop transfusion-transmitted infections or suffer immunological sequelae. Intraoperative cell salvage is recommended by several national policy making organisations as a safe cost-effective alternative to autologous blood transfusion in both emergency and elective settings. Moreover, emerging data has also revealed that autotransfusion of vaginally shed blood is both feasible and safe. These techniques are useful in patients who decline blood transfusions for both personal and religious reasons and should therefore be taken into consideration when planning place of birth.","Hashviniya Sekar, Wasim Lodhi, Wai Yoong","Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology","2024Dec","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Postpartum Hemorrhage; Operative Blood Salvage; Blood Transfusion, Autologous"

Although it is currently impossible to predict the occurrence of redox imbalance, it is possible to identify women with a high or medium risk of developing this disease prior to a negative outcome by non-invasive diagnostic methods. The Aim: This study aimed to examine the possible role of the parameter of oxidative stress (OS) measured in early pregnancy in the screening/treatment of obesity and its complications during pregnancy. Methods: This research was designed as a prospective observational cross-sectional clinical study which included 40 non-obese and 31 obese pregnant women between 11 and 13 g.w. who were managed in the Department of Obstetrics, University Clinical Center Kragujevac in Serbia. We collected anthropometric and clinical indicators, maternal and pregnancy factors, and measured prooxidative parameters from blood samples. Results: We observed significantly increased levels of the superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and the index of lipid peroxidation in the Obese group in comparison with the Non-Obese group and significantly decreased bioavailability of nitrites in the Obese group in comparison with the Non-Obese group. Conclusions: The determination of systemic parameters of OS in early pregnancy could be a good methodological approach in the screening/treatment of obesity during pregnancy and this approach should be followed for the screening of endothelial dysfunction in pregnancy which needs further monitoring and/or treatment.","Vanja Dimitrov, Maria Mikerova, Vladimir Reshetnikov, Victor Mikhailovsky, Sasa Raicevic, Sergey Bolevich, Vladimir Jakovljevic, Tamara Nikolic Turnic","Pathophysiology : the official journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology","2024Sep19",NA

"39311258","Subjective Cognitive Impairment and Physical Activity: Investigating Risk Factors and Correlations among Older Adults in Spain.","Subjective cognitive impairment in older persons has a substantial influence on their quality of life and can progress to serious illnesses such as dementia. Physical activity level can help prevent cognitive decline and improve cognitive performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between frequency of physical activity and subjective cognitive impairment in Spanish adults aged 65 and over, and to identify different risk factors. Using data from the EHSS20 survey, the study focused on 7082 participants who provided information on cognitive impairment and physical activity. Key predictor variables included age, gender, BMI, marital status, and education level. A significant relationship was found between BMI category and gender, with 66.5% of the population being overweight or obese. Men were more likely to be overweight than women. Socio-demographic factors such as educational level, marital status, and physical activity frequency showed dependent associations with sex. Women had a higher prevalence of subjective cognitive impairment than men. A strong association was found between frequency of physical activity and subjective cognitive impairment, with inactive older people having the highest prevalence of subjective cognitive impairment. Older women who engage in little physical exercise and have less education are at risk for subjective cognitive impairment. Furthermore, for both men and women, being overweight was associated with a more reduced risk than obesity. Significant relationships were also discovered between subjective cognitive impairment, frequency of physical exercise, gender, BMI, and degree of education. In conclusion, older, sedentary women with high BMI and less education are more likely to experience subjective cognitive impairment.","Juan Manuel Franco-García, Ángel Denche-Zamorano, Jorge Carlos-Vivas, Antonio Castillo-Paredes, Cristina Mendoza-Holgado, Jorge Pérez-Gómez","Journal of functional morphology and kinesiology","2024Aug28",NA

The primary aim of this research was to investigate injuries and illness within a previous year in Japanese collegiate judo athletes and analyze possible factors associated with these. This was a cross-sectional observational study using a web-based survey to collect data on the 1-year prevalence of injuries and illness. This study involved 564 judo athletes (67% males), aged between 18 and 25 years. Of these, 344 athletes (61%) reported one or more injuries within the previous year, and 49 reported illness (9%). The more judo experiences the athlete acquired, the less likely they were to sustain an injury (OR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.56-1.10; p-value < 0.05) or illness (OR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.81-1.00; p-value < 0.05). Support of an athletic trainer was associated with 1.7 times increased odds of sustaining an injury (95% CI: 1.19-2.49; p-value < 0.05). Athletes with obese BMI status (BMI > 30) had 3.1 times higher odds of becoming ill (95% CI: 1.41-6.95; p-value = 0.005), and athletes training more than 5 days per week had the odds of becoming ill increased by 5.1 times (95% CI: 1.11-23.21; p-value = 0.036). Judokas with fewer years of experience and with obese status should be targeted in efforts to prevent injury and illness.

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we included newly admitted high-functioning older adults (Barthel index > 60) from 47 Japanese LTC facilities. The primary outcome was physical function changes after admission. Data were collected from the Long-Term Care Information System for Evidence (LIFE), which monitored LTC facility residents' function between 1 January 2021 and 31 January 2022. A group-based trajectory model and binomial logistic regression analyses were applied to identify and compare residents' PFTs. Among the 718 residents included, the average age was 85.69 years and 64.5% were female. PFTs were classified as maintenance (66.0%), improvement (9.5%), slight decline (16.6%), and large decline (7.9%). The improvement group had significantly fewer residents who expressed a lack of interest in daily activities (odds ratio (OR) 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.97) compared to the maintenance group. The large decline group had significantly more residents with a low BMI at admission (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.29-4.55) and residents who did not use dentures (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.26-0.95), compared to the maintenance group.

This study retrospectively analysed the rate at which patients reported GLP-1 RA dispensing errors from patient-selected and partner pharmacies of Australia's largest DWLS provider over a six-month period. The analysis found that 99 (0.35%) of the 28,165 dispensed semaglutide orders contained an error. Incorrect dose (58.6%) and unreasonable medication expiry window (21.2%) were the two most common error types. Most errors (84.9%) were deemed to have been of medium urgency, with 11.1% being considered high-urgency errors. Incorrect doses (45.5%) and supplies of the wrong medication (36.3%) comprised most errors reported in high-urgency cases.

"39310928","Sensitive periods and other timing hypotheses in developmental psychopathology: A tutorial.","Researchers often aim to assess whether repeated measures of an exposure are associated with repeated measures of an outcome. A question of particular interest is how associations between exposures and outcomes may differ over time. In other words, researchers may seek the best form of a temporal model. While several models are possible, researchers often consider a few key models. For example, researchers may hypothesize that an exposure measured during a sensitive period may be associated with repeated measures of the outcome over time. Alternatively, they may hypothesize that the exposure measured immediately before the current time period may be most strongly associated with the outcome at the current time. Finally, they may hypothesize that all prior exposures are important. Many analytic methods cannot compare and evaluate these alternative temporal models, perhaps because they make the restrictive assumption that the associations between exposures and outcomes remains constant over time. Instead, we provide a tutorial describing four temporal models that allow the associations between repeated measures of exposures and outcomes to vary, and showing how to test which temporal model is best supported by the data. By finding the best temporal model, developmental psychopathology researchers can find optimal windows for intervention.","LillyBelle K Deer, Kylie K Harrall, Deborah H Glueck, Elysia Poggi Davis, Keith E Muller, Dana Dabelea, Jenalee R Doom","Development and psychopathology","2024Sep23",NA

Here, we compared longitudinal plasma liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry metabolomic changes between carriers and noncarriers. We analyzed the association of risk haplotype with metabolites leveraging repeated assessments using multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models. Before the intervention, carriers (N = 21) showed higher concentrations of hippurate, C16 carnitine, glycine, and cinnamoylglycine. After 24 wk of LSI, carriers exhibited a deleterious metabolomic profile. This profile was characterized by increased concentrations of hippurate, cinnamoglycine, xanthosine, N-acetylputrescine, L-acetylcarnitine, ceramide (d18:1/24:1), and decreased concentrations of citrulline and phosphatidylethanolamine. These metabolites were associated with higher concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The effect of LSI on the risk haplotype was notably more pronounced in its impact on 2 metabolites: methylmalonylcarnitine (β: -0.56; P-interaction = 0.014) and betaine (β: -0.64; P-interaction = 0.017). Interestingly, lower consumption across visits of polyunsaturated (β: -0.038; P = 0.017) fatty acids were associated with higher concentrations of methylmalonylcarnitine. Covariates for adjustment across models included age, sex, genetic ancestry principal components, and body mass index. Our study highlights the persistence of deleterious metabolomic patterns associated with the risk haplotype before and during a 24-wk LSI. We also emphasize the potential regulatory role of polyunsaturated fatty acids on methylmalonylcarnitine concentrations suggesting a route for improving interventions for individuals with high-genetic risk.","Magdalena Sevilla-González, Maria Fernanda Garibay-Gutiérrez, Arsenio Vargas-Vázquez, Andrea Celeste Medina-García, Maria Luisa Ordoñez-Sánchez, Clary B Clish, Paloma Almeda-Valdes, Teresa Tusie-Luna","Current developments in nutrition","2024Sep",NA
"39310632","Gastric Nodule Turned Rare Gastric Xanthoma.","Gastric nodules (polyps) are a common finding in routine endoscopic procedures. Uncommonly, gastric nodules turn out to be lipid-filled waxy lesions called xanthomas. In this case report, we discuss a rare incidence of a gastric nodule turning out to be a xanthoma in a 50-year-old male patient. Xanthomas of the GI tract occur by the exact mechanism as their cutaneous counterpart and are relatively uncommon. A 50-year-old male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hyperlipidemia, and constipation presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of epigastric discomfort, bloating, and gastric reflux, all starting the night before admission. Gastroenterology was consulted, and they performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during the admission due to the patient's age and long history of GERD. EGD showed mild gastritis and xanthelasma. The patient's upper GI symptoms improved. All other workups were negative. Right upper quadrant (RUQ) US performed showed hepatic steatosis. With lifestyle changes, the patient's alkaline phosphatase returned to normal. After a month of medical management, GERD symptoms reoccurred. Repeat EGD was performed, and xanthomatous aggregates were shown, suggesting xanthoma. Upper GI symptoms continued. Gastric xanthomas are a rare occurrence. Most xanthomas in the upper GI tract are located in the stomach and have various causes. The risk for malignancy is low; these lesions are commonly confused for malignancies, prompting biopsy and histology. Overall, xanthomas are rare findings with a sinister look but benign results.","Andrej M Sodoma, James R Pellegrini, Atul Sinha, Reid Coover, Tulika Saggar","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39310616","Gender Differences in the Clinical Profile of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor-Related Urinary Tract Infections.","Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) are a novel class of oral antidiabetic agents with proven cardiovascular and mortality benefits. By promoting glucosuria, SGLT2Is increase the risk of genital and urinary tract infections (UTIs), which remain uncomplicated in most cases. Comparative studies detailing the gender differences in the clinical profile of SGLT2I-related UTIs (SUTIs) are lacking. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the gender-related differences in the clinical profile of SUTIs. Methodology This prospective study enrolled 100 consecutive diabetes mellitus patients with UTI symptoms who were on SGLT2Is. In addition to collecting clinical details, patients were subjected to the following investigations: complete blood counts, urea, creatine, liver function, lipid components, urine analysis, urine culture, and ultrasonography. Results Females (n = 80) outnumbered males (n = 20). Although females were younger than males (53.68 ± 10.26 vs. 63.30 ± 10.75 years, p = 0.003), body mass index (29.84 ± 7.22 vs. 24.62 ± 3.10 kg/m2, p = 0.008) and waist circumference (103.01 ± 14.49 vs. 93.75 ± 4.50 cm, p = 0.109) were higher in females. About 22.5% of females had undergone hysterectomy. The mean duration of diabetes mellitus was longer in males (10.64 ± 6.74 vs. 7.78 ± 4.75 years), whereas the median duration of SGLT2I use (4 (interquartile range (IQR) = 1-12) vs. 3 (IQR = 2-4) months) and mean HbA1c levels were not different between the two groups. A greater proportion of males were complicated by retinopathy (55% vs. 15%) and proteinuria (65% vs. 17.5%), while neuropathy (85% vs. 71.25%) rates were similar. Overall, 35% of males had complicated UTIs (renal abscess, pyelonephritis, prostatic abscess) compared to only 3.75% of females (p = 0.001). Conclusions The majority of SUTIs are uncomplicated in females whereas in males one-third are complicated infections. Although females with SUTI had a higher prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia, males had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus and higher retinopathy prevalence. Extreme caution should be exercised in patients at risk for SUTI before prescribing SGLT2I.","Mohammad Hayat Bhat, Mohammad Salem Baba, Md Ejaz Alam, Abid Hussain Bhat, Shahnawaz Mir, Basharat Qayoom Dar, Shoiab Mohd Patto, Pooran Sharma","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39310615","Short-Term Efficacy of Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty Versus Intragastric Balloon Insertion for Obesity: An Indonesian, Single-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study.","Introduction  As a medical condition, obesity is a global public health concern that still has no satisfactory solution. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and intragastric balloon (IGB) are proven to be safe and efficient in producing weight loss. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty has achieved significant success; therefore, it is timely to compare it to intragastric balloon therapy. Methods  We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data for patients undergoing ESG or IGB. Weight was recorded at one week, one month, and three months post-procedure, and the percentage of total body weight loss (%TBWL) was calculated. Severe adverse events requiring hospital admission/procedure reversal were also recorded. We aim to see if one procedure is more efficient in providing weight loss in a short-term period.  Results A total of 20 patients underwent ESG and 31 patients underwent IGB insertion. ESG patients showed a superior mean %TBWL at one-week post-procedure (%TBWL±SD = 4.87±1.88 vs 3.76±1.95). IGB patients showed a higher mean of %TBWL at one-month post-procedure (%TBWL±SD = 8.00±3.60 vs 7.25±3.29). Both procedures show similar %TBWL at three months post-procedure (%TBWL±SD ESG = 10.857±3.83 vs %TBWL ± SD IGB = 10.852±5.78). Conclusions  We found that both the IGB insertion and ESG procedures result in clinically significant weight loss. However, the short-term weight loss between these two procedures is similar. Although similar, the number of adverse events in the IGB group is significantly higher than in the ESG group.","Peter I Limas, Jeffrey Budhipramono, Andre S Suryadi, Adrian P Setiawan, Lady D Alfara","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39310569","Beyond Numbers: How Biochemical Parameters Can Predict Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.","Introduction The treatment and management of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) requires constant evaluation through the assessment of biochemical markers. This is necessary for treatment, to prevent progression to complications such as mineral bone disease, and to improve quality of life. We aimed to study the biochemical profile of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) grades 4 and 5 on MHD, identify markers altered due to different etiologies, duration of illness, and duration of hemodialysis, and create a panel of markers that can be useful in planning better management. Methods All consecutive patients attending the dialysis unit of ESIC Super Speciality Hospital with CKD grade 4 or grade 5 on MHD between 2019 and 2020 were recruited. A detailed clinical history and demographic profile were taken, and blood samples were collected from the patients during follow-up visits in plain and EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) tubes for analysis. Results A total of 312 patients (22.1% females and 77.9% males.) with a mean age of 49.74 ± 11.49 years were recruited. In the study population, diabetic nephropathy (DN) (17%) and hypertensive nephropathy (48.7%) were the two most prevalent causes of CKD. The majority (64%) of the patients were on MHD three times a week. The range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (ml/min/1.73 m2) at the time of initiation of MHD was 2.9-26.8 according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. The mean duration of MHD was 51.58 months, with a mortality rate of 5.9% during the follow-up period (3-108 months). Conclusion Optimal selection and combination of biochemical tests will help in ascertaining the adequacy of management, progress of disease, or complications in MHD patients. This in turn will help guide the clinicians in effectively using these markers in their day-to-day practice.","Imran A Siddiqui, Afshan Masood, Sushmita Chandagiri, Raichur V Kumar, Altaf A Mir","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

Methods The randomized controlled study was conducted over 24 months, involving 80 patients aged 18-65 years who had peritonitis and underwent emergency midline laparotomies. Patients with diabetes mellitus, a BMI >35 kg/m², immunocompromised conditions, or those requiring re-exploration within 30 days of surgery were excluded. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups using a computer-generated randomization table: Group A, the case group, consisted of 40 patients who received NPDs, while Group B, the control group, included 40 patients who received conventional dressings. Data were recorded in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), with a p-value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Results The overall occurrence of SSIs within the 30-day follow-up period was significantly lower in the NPD group compared to the conventional dressing group (30% vs. 70%, p < 0.05). The mean duration of hospital stay was 14.85 ± 10.43 days for the NPD group and 15.4 ± 9.75 days for the control group, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.712). The mean Vancouver Scar Scale score was 5.3 ± 2.47 in the NPD group and 6.5 ± 2.14 in the control group, also showing no statistically significant difference (p = 0.11).

"39310485","Predictive Factors for Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Observational Study.","Introduction Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form of osteoarthritis. It is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, physical examination, and imaging, most frequently by knee X-ray in at least two views. In front of a patient with early KOA, all the predictive factors and risk factors that can be modified, but also that can lead to a rapid evolution of the symptoms and the need for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), must be taken into account and identified. There were a series of prognostic factors associated with KOA, such as age, sex, BMI, degree of physical activity, decrease in bone mineral density, C-reactive protein, malalignment, clinical severity at baseline, and previous traumas. The treatment of KOA is varied and involves pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures and surgical treatment in the final stages of evolution. Materials and methods In the University Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania, patients with KOA presented to the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, and those who required surgical treatment, such as TKA, arthroscopy, or non-surgical treatment, were enrolled. We conducted a descriptive and prospective observational study that included 70 patients clinically and imaging diagnosed with KOA. The inclusion criteria consisted of a patient over 45 years old with knee pain and radiological signs of KOA. The exclusion criteria referred to patients with recent traumatic history, signs of active osteoarticular infection, the lack of radiological changes of KOA that imposed the differential diagnosis, patients known to have rheumatological diseases in the Algic phase, and patients in whom it was not possible to collect complete required data. Results Patients who required TKA were older (65.12 ± 8.19 years) than patients who required other therapeutic interventions (52.55 ± 3.63 years), the difference of 12.57 years being statistically significant (t = -8.882, p ≤ 0.001). Women were more than three times more likely to require TKA than men (80.85% vs. 52.17%, OR = 3.87, CI [1.29, 11.56]). Patients with HBP were more than four times more likely to require TKA than patients without HBP (78.57% vs. 42.86%, OR = 4.88, CI [1.42, 16.82]). Patients with elevated ESR were more than 26 times more likely to require TKA than patients with normal ESR (96.67% vs. 52.50%, OR = 26.23, CI [3.25, 211.67]). There are statistically significant differences between the non-TKA group (mean rank = 60.20) and TKA patients' score (mean rank = 25.62) (U = 6.000, Z = -6.606, p ≤ 0.001). Thus, patients who required TKA had a significantly lower KSS score than patients who required other treatments. Conclusion According to the data obtained in the studied group of patients, the characteristics of the patient at high risk of requiring TKA are the following: a female patient over 65 years of age who associates hypertension, high ESR, and fibrinogen values ​​with KSS score and KSS function with low values, recording an average value of 56.70.","Sergiu Iordache, Adrian Cursaru, Bogdan Cretu, Cosmin-Florentin Niculae, Mihnea Popa, Mihai Aurel Costache, Bogdan Serban, Catalin Cirstoiu","Cureus","2024Aug",NA
"39310459","Hepatorenal Syndrome in the Setting of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Chronic Lymphedema: A Case Report.","Cholangiocarcinomas are aggressive cancers originating in the bile ducts, classified based on their location as intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal, and often present with symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Hepatorenal syndrome, a severe complication of liver failure that impairs kidney function and worsens prognosis, further complicates the management of these tumors. We present the case of a 49-year-old Caucasian male who initially sought treatment for jaundice and associated symptoms, including severe itching, gray-colored stools, and fatigue. His medical history, including recent gastric sleeve surgery, obesity, and smoking, along with symptoms of weight loss and increased leg swelling, initially obscured the severity of his condition. Diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests eventually revealed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) and hepatorenal syndrome. Despite the poor prognosis of hepatorenal syndrome, which typically requires liver transplantation for a definitive cure, the patient chose aggressive treatment following stabilization of his renal function. This case highlights the importance of a thorough diagnostic approach in patients presenting with jaundice and vague symptoms, especially as the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma rises, particularly among younger populations. Early and accurate diagnosis, combined with prompt intervention, is crucial for improving patient outcomes in this challenging clinical scenario.","Sean Lief, Mohammed A Khan, Axel B Lichtenberg, Srihita Patibandla, Ali Z Ansari","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

In addition to the clinical data being available digitally in subsystems, the preparation of more complex cases requires literature research. Several expert systems have been developed to support this process. However, the interaction with these systems has to be trained. Current development enables linguistic interaction with such artificial intelligence (AI) systems. To the best of our knowledge, these have not been tested as premedical screening tools for MDT. Methods This is a retrospective consecutive case series of 10 cervical cancer cases comparing the medical recommendations of the MDT and artificial intelligence (AI) on a low level (i.e., surgery, systemic treatment, and radiotherapy). Results The clinical cases ranged from primary diagnosis via suspected recurrence to palliative settings. The AI repeatedly stated that medical professionals need to be consulted before treatment decisions. The AI answers ranged from no agreement to overachievement by mentioning treatment options for preexisting risk factors (such as obesity). In standard cases, the AI answer matched well with the expert recommendations. In some cases, the AI answers were contrary to our treatment recommendation. Conclusion The interaction with current language AIs is temptingly easy, and the replies are very understandable. Despite the AI warning regarding medical recommendations in the majority of our cases, there was a good match with the MDT recommendations. However, in some cases, the medical evidence behind the answers was missing or in the worst case fictional. In our case series, the AI did not meet the requirements to support a clinical MDT meeting by prescreening the therapeutic options. However, it did exceed the expectations regarding the risk factors of the patients.","Florian Ebner, Andreas Hartkopf, Kristina Veselinovic, Fabienne Schochter, Wolfgang Janni, Stefan Lukac, Davut Dayan","Cureus","2024Aug",NA

In this cohort, nearly half of those who underwent MBS as adolescents screened positive for alcohol use disorder, symptoms of alcohol-related harm, or alcohol-related problems within 8 years post-surgery. Moreover, persistent or heavy marijuana use following MBS during adolescence is higher than national data. This study includes 217 adolescents (aged 13-19 years) enrolled in a 5-center prospective cohort study who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical sleeve gastrectomy between 2007 and 2011 and were followed for up to 8 years. Participants self-reported alcohol use via the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and substance use for up to 8 years. Female sex, pre-surgery lower body mass index, and pre-surgery substance use were independently associated with increased risk of incident post-surgery hazardous drinking. Pre-surgery psychiatric counseling was significantly associated with increased risk for new-onset substance use post-surgery. Starting substance use post-surgery or continuing pre- to post-surgery was independently associated with a higher risk of post-surgery hazardous drinking. Greater percent weight loss, starting post-surgery or continuing pre- to post-surgery psychiatric counseling, using alcohol, and hazardous drinking were independently associated with a higher risk of post-surgery substance use.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 88 young non-athletic normal-weight Saudi subjects were recruited from Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia with mean age (21.3 ± 1.5 years), weight: (64.7 ± 7.5 kg), height: (172.3 ± 6.1 cm) and body mass index: (21.8 ± 2.1). All subjects were interviewed and examined for eligibility, after which they performed maximum graded exercise testing on a treadmill to obtain VO2max. The predicted VO2max was also generated using the following formulae (Edvardsen, Fairbarns, FRIENDS, Hansen, and Jones). Results: The mean measured VO2max was 41.9 ± 7.2 ml/kg/min. While the predicted VO2max using the formulae were: Edvardsen = 66.8 ± 7.9, Fairbarns = 64.1 ± 4.7, FRIENDS = 53.5 ± 2.2, Hansen = 42.8 ± 0.54, and Jones = 50.9 ± 5.1 ml/kg/min. There was a significant difference between all the predicted VO2max and the measured one using the paired t-test (P < 0.001), except for the Hansen's predicted value (P = 0.212). The effect size index (Cohen's d) for the comparison of Hansen's VO2max and measured VO2max was trivial and equal to 0.13. The Bland-Altman test showed good agreement between the measured and Hansen's predicted VO2max. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the mean VO2max value of young, healthy, and non-athletic Saudi men. This value was lower than Western values, which might be due to low physical activity or racial differences. Most international formulae overestimate the VO2max in this population, except for the Hansen equation. Therefore, Hansen's predicted VO2max might be the best available reference value for the diagnosis and prognosis of young Saudi individuals undergoing maximum exercise testing.","Khaled Sayar, Abdullah Bamosa, Lubna Al-Asoom, Ayad Mohammed Salem, Qassim Muaidi","International journal of medical sciences","2024","Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Saudi Arabia; Exercise Test; Cross-Sectional Studies; Young Adult; Adult; Exercise; Body Mass Index"
"39310015","Stress levels and eating behavior among university students in Jordan: A cross-sectional study.","Increased body weight is common among university students; transitioning from high school to university may increase perceived stress levels, thus changing dietary habits and metabolism to promote overweight or obesity. The current study investigates the association between stress and dietary habits among university students in Jordan. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 221 university students aged between 20 and 25 at Applied Science Private University [ASU]. A self-reported questionnaire was distributed to university students. The questionnaires were divided into three sections: the first was about general characteristics, body weight, change in body weight, and stress eating. The survey of 208 participants showed that 64.3% were females, and 84.2% of students lived with their families. Results showed that more than half [51.1%] of the respondents were dissatisfied with their eating habits. Females [57.7%] monitored their food intake more than males did. However, most males [77.2%] reported less eating during stress compared to females. In addition, the data analysis revealed that those who ate more were less likely to monitor their food intake [χ 2 =9.734, df = 1, P = .002] or quantity [χ 2 =16.704, df = 1, P < .001]. Only 20.8% of the participants preferred sports or hobbies as a stress reduction activity; 29.4% took showers, while 51.1% ignored what made them stressed. Finally, 56.3% of participants reported increased weight after starting university, and it was significantly correlated with stress eating while studying for exams [χ 2 =8.762, df = 2, P = .013]. Stress affects university students and can lead to unhealthy eating habits and health issues like obesity. Many students face stress during their academic years, which affects their dietary choices.

This cross-sectional study is part of the national health transformation plan shaped in response to the emerging epidemic of noncommunicable diseases. In the present study, 6,331 participants aged 30 years and older were randomly and census selected from comprehensive urban and rural health service centers in Naein County, in Isfahan, Iran, respectively. The data were collected using the electronic health record from the IraPEN program in two sections: demographic information and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. They were then analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 24 software using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression. The participants' mean age was 55.09 ± 16.11 years. The main risk factor was insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables while smoking was a negligible risk factor. Low physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and high body mass index were more prevalent in females than in males, whereas smoking was more frequently reported in males (P < 0.001). Risk factors such as age, gender, education level, place of residence, and marital status, played a significant role in determining CVD risk factors. More than half of Iranian adults had one or older cardiovascular disease-related risk factors, and the prevalence of such factors was higher in females than in males. Given the importance of gender differences in cardiovascular disease-related health habits, it is necessary to reduce the majority of these diseases in society, especially in women, by controlling modifiable risk factors.","Fatemeh Saber, Nasrin Ezadbakhsh, Mohammad J Tarrahi","Journal of education and health promotion","2024",NA

The results showed that boys enrolled in a sports activity had lower body mass (-17.9%, P < 0.05 d = 0.72), body mass index (-13.4%, P < 0.05, d = 0.87), and body fat (%) (-54.1%, P < 0.05, d = 1.38) and higher VO2max 32.3% (P < 0.05, d = 3.67), than the non-active group. The boys active in sports clubs also had better results in the total number of items processed (11%, P < 0.05 d = 0.50) and in concentration performance (17.7%, P < 0.05 d = 0.56) than the non-active group. In correlation analyses, VO2max was negatively associated with body mass, body mass index, and body fat (P = 0.011; P = 0.001 and P = 0.00, respectively) and positively related to the total number of items processed and concentration performance (P = 0.003 and P = 0.015, respectively). In the Pearson Correlation analyses, body fat showed a lower negative correlation with TN (r = 0.33; P = 0.003) and CP (r = 0.28; P = 0.015). Boys participating in regular sports have lower body mass, BMI, and BF values. In addition, boys who participated in sports showed higher imaginary fitness and selective attention and concentration capacity results, as expected, for any sports part compared to their body peers. Another attempt from this study is that body mass and body fat percentage recovery are negatively associated with fitness. Considering the increasing prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents due to sedentary living, which has become a worldwide epidemic, it is recommended that pedagogical and public health strategies and policies be developed based on the physical fitness level of children.","Bahar Ates, Halil Tanir, Yasin Akinci","Journal of education and health promotion","2024",NA
"39309871","Predictors of body image perceptions among healthcare providers in Terengganu, Malaysia.","The study's aim was to find predictors of body image perception scores among health care providers (HCPs) in Terengganu, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study among 201 health care providers (HCPs) was conducted from January to March 2023. This study participants were drawn from a pool of HCPs with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher. Body image perceptions were scored using the Malay version of the Body Self-Image Questionnaire-Short Form. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the predictors of body image perception scores. Age and longer work hours correlate with higher body satisfaction among HCPs, while higher BMI lowers satisfaction. Nurses typically experience more height dissatisfaction. Higher income is associated with better self-ratings in looks, health, and fitness, but higher education correlates with poorer self-ratings. Married HCPs report lower attractiveness, health, fitness, and self-esteem but are more satisfied with their height. This situational analysis identifies predictors, such as sociodemographic factors and occupational aspects, that can aid in customising interventions to address specific body image concerns among HCPs, with the goal of reducing obesity prevalence among them.","Siti Fatimah Samsury, Mohd Nazri Shafei, Mohd Ismail Ibrahim, Wan Nor Arifin, Noriah Mahmud","Heliyon","2024Sep30",NA
"39309697","Factors associated with receiving an obesity diagnosis and obesity-related treatment for patients with obesity class II and III within a single integrated health system.","The prevalence and associated adverse effects of obesity on health and healthcare cost make it a primary public health concern. However, individuals with the physiological features of obesity may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. We aimed to determine the prevalence of obesity diagnoses and obesity-related treatments in an integrated health system and determine the factors associated with receiving an obesity diagnosis and treatment for this indication. This retrospective cross-sectional study of data from the Henry Ford Health electronic health record included adult patients with a body mass index (BMI) indicating clinical evidence of class II and III (severe) obesity in 2017 and who received treatment through 2019. The primary outcome was prevalence of obesity diagnosis and obesity-related treatment. Logistic regression evaluated the patient-level factors associated with odds of having obesity diagnosis and treatment. Among 64,741 patients meeting the clinical definition of definition of severe obesity, only 40.7 % were clinically diagnosed with obesity, and 23.5 % received an obesity-related intervention. Patients with BMI≥40 kg/m2 (class III) were more likely to be diagnosed with obesity than those with BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 (class II) (odds ratio [OR] 5.84; 95 % CI, 5.62-6.07). Patients with a diagnosis of obesity (OR 2.92; 95 % CI, 2.80-3.05), Black patients (OR 1.46; 95 % CI, 1.40-1.53), and female patients (OR 1.47; 95 % CI, 1.41-1.54) were more likely to be offered obesity-related treatment.

We conducted a prospective intervention cohort study involving 20 individuals with SCI (aged 28-60) with neurologic injuries at levels C4-T10 and ASIA scale grades A-D, lasting over a year. Our study assessed the impact of a therapeutic lifestyle intervention (TLI) based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and its maintenance phase. The TLI comprised circuit resistance training, a Mediterranean-style calorie-restricted diet, and tailored behavioral support. Key outcomes measured included cardiometabolic risks (plasma analytes and disease biomarkers), anthropometrics (body mass, BMI, tissue composition), global metabolism, fitness (aerobic capacity, peak strength), and health-related quality of life (SF36). Results demonstrated a significant reduction in body mass and BMI by 7.5%, a 7% decrease in total fat mass, and substantial improvements in glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity. Lipid profiles improved, with reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C, and increased HDL-C. Resting energy expenditure and fat oxidation increased by 27.4% and 58.5%, respectively. Aerobic capacity and dynamic strength also improved significantly. The Physical and Mental Composite Scores of the SF36 improved by 22.8% and 30.5%, respectively. Following the maintenance phase, several positive outcomes persisted, indicating a reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease and comorbid disorders. Our findings support the effectiveness of TLI in reducing cardiometabolic risks, enhancing fitness, and improving health-related quality of life in individuals with chronic SCI.

This cross-sectional investigation encompassed 6488 participants with diabetes and pre-diabetes who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2007 and 2016. The association of the TyG and combined obesity index with chest pain and CVD was investigated using weighted logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to compare different indicators. In multivariate logistic regression fully adjusted for confounding variables, our analyses revealed significant associations between TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR and chest pain, with adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 1.21 (1.05, 1.39), 1.06 (1.01, 1.11), 1.08 (1.04, 1.14), and 1.27 (1.08, 1.48), respectively. For total-CVD, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.32 (1.08, 1.61), 1.10 (1.03, 1.17), 1.13 (1.06, 1.19), and 1.63 (1.35, 1.97), respectively, among which TyG, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR present curvilinear associations in RCS analysis (all P-nonlinear < 0.05). Furthermore, the ROC curve showed that TyG-WC had the most robust predictive efficacy for total-CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), and myocardial infarction (MI), while TyG-WHtR had the best predictive ability for angina and heart failure. There are significant associations of TyG and its related indicators with chest pain and total-CVD among the pathoglycemia population.

This study evaluated the relationship between outdoor nighttime light exposure and AD prevalence in the United States using satellite acquired outdoor nighttime light intensity and Medicare data. Higher outdoor nighttime light was associated with higher prevalence of AD. While atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and stroke were associated more strongly with AD prevalence than nighttime light intensity, nighttime light was more strongly associated with AD prevalence than alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, depression, heart failure, and obesity. Startlingly, nighttime light exposure more strongly associated with AD prevalence in those under the age of 65 than any other disease factor examined. These data suggest light exposure at night may influence AD, but additional studies are needed.","Robin M Voigt, Bichun Ouyang, Ali Keshavarzian","Frontiers in neuroscience","2024",NA

This was further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine is considered a potential strategy to address inequitable access to healthcare; however, it only gained popularity during the pandemic. This study aims to determine the pediatric conditions diagnosed through telemedicine consults and the platforms utilized by patients in the Philippine Primary Care Studies pilot sites during the pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients below 19 years of age who sought consult using telemedicine. Using the electronic medical records (EMR) system adapted by the Philippine Primary Care Studies in UP Health Service (UPHS) Quezon City, Metro Manila (urban site), Samal, Bataan (rural site), and Bulusan, Sorsogon (remote site), pediatric conditions diagnosed through telemedicine consults and the platforms utilized by patients from September 2021 to August 2022 were extracted and summarized. Data was summarized using descriptive statistics. A total of 5,388 consults involving pediatric patients were recorded from September 2021 to August 2022, of which 1,562 (29.0%) were done through telemedicine. Majority of the telemedicine consults (67.5%, n=1,055) were in the rural site. There were 274 telemedicine consults (17.6%) in the remote site, and 233 (14.9%) in the urban site. The most common diagnosis was acute upper respiratory tract infection (30.8%). Other common conditions diagnosed through telemedicine were lower respiratory tract infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, obesity, anxiety disorders, allergic rhinitis, conditions related to pregnancy, and myalgia.

"39308877","The Correlation between Unilateral Hip Bridge Endurance and Lumbar Multifidi Sonologic Characteristics in Physically Active Allied Healthcare Professionals at St. Luke's Medical Center - Quezon City: A Cross-sectional Study.","Low back pain is one of the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Healthcare workers are prone to low back pain because of the nature of their profession. Low back pain may be related to lumbar multifidi atrophy or instability and poor core stability. Core stability can be assessed using the unilateral hip bridge endurance test. This cross-sectional study aims to determine the correlation between unilateral hip bridge endurance (UHBE) and sonologic characteristics of the bilateral L4-L5 lumbar multifidus muscles of physically active allied healthcare professionals. Forty (40) physically active healthcare professionals (mean age = 31.3 ± 6.39 years, mean height = 161.17 ± 8.45 cm, mean weight = 61.88 ± 13.58 kg, mean BMI = 23.61 ± 3.68 kg/m2) were recruited via purposive sampling. The participants answered online versions of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and Oswestry Disability Index. They subsequently underwent the UHBE test and ultrasound assessment of the L4-L5 multifidi. Multiplied anteroposterior (AP) and lateral linear (L) measurements were used to estimate L4-L5 multifidi size. The Pearson test was used to test for correlation between the primary outcomes of the study. There was no statistically significant correlation between Lumbar Multifidi CSA and UHBE Scores (r = -0.172, p > 0.05), and between Lumbar Multifidi CSA% Difference and UHBE Scores (r = -0.140, p > 0.05). However, results showed a very weak negative correlation between the Lumbar Multifidi CSA% Difference and UHBE Scores. There is no definite evidence showing a correlation between core stability tests such as the unilateral hip bridge test scores and sonologic characteristics of the lumbar multifidi. However, lumbar multifidi symmetry may have a role with core stability. The correlation between core stability tests and lumbar multifidus morphology should be further investigated.","Emmanuel S Navarroza, Gilmore C Senolos, Carl Froilan D Leochico","Acta medica Philippina","2024",NA
"39308871","Effect of pioglitazone on inflammatory response and clinical outcome in T2DM patients with COVID-19: a randomized multicenter double-blind clinical trial.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a rapidly spreading contagious disease across the globe. Recent studies showed that people with diabetes mellitus, severe obesity, and cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. It has been suggested that the increased risk is due to the chronic inflammatory state associated with type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone, a strong insulin sensitizer with anti-inflammatory properties, in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted with moderate-severe COVID-19. We enrolled 350 patients with type 2 diabetes who were admitted to hospitals in Qatar and Kuwait with COVID-19. Patients were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, pioglitazone (n = 189) or a matching placebo (n = 161) for 28 days. The study had two primary outcomes: (1) the incidence of a composite outcome composed of (a) the requirement for mechanical ventilation, (b) death, and (c) myocardial damage; and (2) an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The first primary outcome occurred in 28 participants (8%), and the secondary outcome occurred in 17. Treatment with pioglitazone showed a significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-3 levels compared with placebo treatment (mean (SD) 2.73 (± 2.14) [95% CI: 0.02, 1.1], p = 0.043 vs. 2.28 (± 1.67) [95% CI: - 0.23, 0.86], p = 0.3, respectively), with no effect seen in the levels of other inflammatory markers. Even though not significant, a few of the patients on pioglitazone exhibited serum troponin levels > 3 times higher than the normal range seen in patients on placebo. On the other hand, more patients on pioglitazone were admitted to the ICU than those with placebo, and no significant difference in the CRP reduction was observed between the two groups. The results of the present study demonstrate that pioglitazone treatment did not independently provide any additional clinical benefit to patients with type 2 diabetes admitted with a COVID-19 infection. https://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04604223.","Khaled Baagar, Thamer Alessa, Mohamed Abu-Farha, Jehad Abubaker, Heba Alhumaidi, Jose Antonio Franco Ceruto, Mohammad Khair Hamad, Ali Omrani, Salma Abdelrahman, Muhammad Zaka-Ul Haq, Abdul Wajid Safi, Bassem Alhariri, Manish Barman, Alaaeldin Abdelmajid, Humberto Vidal Denis Cancio, Eman Elmekaty, Irina Al-Khairi, Preethi Cherian, Lina Jayyousi, Mohammed Ahmed, Mohammed Qaddoumi, Sulaiman Hajji, Ahmad Esmaeel, Ali Al-Andaleeb, Arshad Channanath, Sriraman Devarajan, Hamad Ali, Thangavel Alphonse Thanaraj, Salman Al-Sabah, Fahd Al-Mulla, Muhammad Abdul-Ghani, Amin Jayyousi","Frontiers in immunology","2024","Humans; Pioglitazone; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Double-Blind Method; COVID-19; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; SARS-CoV-2; Hypoglycemic Agents; Treatment Outcome; Aged; C-Reactive Protein; Qatar; Inflammation; Adult; Kuwait"
"39308771","Correlation of anogenital distance from childhood to age 9 years-a prospective population-based birth cohort-the Odense Child Cohort.","Does anogenital distance (AGD) - distance from the anus to the genitals - correlate from infancy (3 months) to the age of 9 years in boys and girls? In boys, AGD correlated from infancy to 9 years of age, whereas in girls, correlations were weaker, especially between infancy and later childhood. AGD is considered a marker for prenatal androgen action. In males, reduced AGD is associated with testicular cancer, infertility, and lower sperm count. In females, AGD is associated with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome. In the Odense Child Cohort, a prospective population-based birth cohort, pregnant women were enrolled in early pregnancy. AGD and BMI were measured repeatedly in children at ages 3 and 18 months, as well as at 3, 5, 7, and 9 years. AGD was measured from the anus to the scrotum (AGDas) and to the penis (AGDap) in 1022 boys, and to the posterior fourchette and the clitoris in 887 girls repeatedly between the age of 3 months to 9 years. In total, 7706 assessments were made. AGD was adjusted for body weight, and SD scores (the difference between individual AGD and the mean of AGD in the population divided by SD of AGD) were calculated for each child. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of each measurement was performed to investigate whether individual AGD was stable during childhood. Short predictive values at 3 months (20th percentile) to 9 years were investigated using the AUC produced by the receiver operating characteristic curve. In boys, AGD/body size-index SD score correlated significantly between infancy and 9 years, strongest for AGDas (r = 0.540 P > 0.001). In girls, weaker significant correlation coefficients were found between AGD at infancy and 9 years; higher correlation coefficients were found between AGD from 3 to 9 years (P > 0.001). Short AGDas in infancy predicted short AGDas in boys aged 9 years (AUC: 0.767, sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.71). The predictive values of short infant AGDap, penile width (in boys), and AGD (in girls) concerning short outcomes at 9 years were low. The AGD measurements are less precisely measurable in girls compared to boys, especially in infancy, resulting in less reproducible measurements. Additionally, because AGD is shorter in girls, the same absolute measurement error is relatively more significant, potentially contributing to greater variability and lower reproducibility in girls. This may contribute to the weaker correlations in girls compared to boys. In boys, AGDas, relative to body size, correlated from infancy to 9 years, suggesting that AGD in infancy can be considered a non-invasive marker of later reproductive health. Further follow-up studies are needed to evaluate long-term individual tracking of AGD as well as assessment of childhood AGD as early marker of adult reproductive health.

Therefore, the Taiwan Society of Cardiology developed these best-evidence preventive guidelines for decision-making in clinical practice involving aspects of primordial prevention including national policies, promotion of health education, primary prevention of clinical risk factors, and management and control of clinical risk factors. These guidelines cover the full spectrum of ASCVD, including chronic coronary syndrome, acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and aortic aneurysm. In order to enhance medical education and health promotion not only for physicians but also for the general public, we propose a slogan (2H2L) for the primary prevention of ASCVD on the basis of the essential role of healthy dietary pattern and lifestyles: ""Healthy Diet and Healthy Lifestyles to Help Your Life and Save Your Lives"". We also propose an acronym of the modifiable risk factors/enhancers and relevant strategies to facilitate memory: "" ABC2D2EFG-I'M2 ACE"": Adiposity, Blood pressure, Cholesterol and Cigarette smoking, Diabetes mellitus and Dietary pattern, Exercise, Frailty, Gout/hyperuricemia, Inflammation/infection, Metabolic syndrome and Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, Atmosphere (environment), Chronic kidney disease, and Easy life (sleep well and no stress).

We sought to characterize the long-term evolution of their gonadal function. Retrospective longitudinal single-center study in 27 men (11 with testicular adrenal rest tissue [TART]), median observation period 12 years, testosterone (T), 11-oxygenated androgens, gonadotropins, and inhibin B measurement at each time point. T concentrations were below the normal range (n.s.) in 43.2% (no TART) and 54.6% (TART) per patient. After accounting for body mass index, sex hormone-binding globulin, and age, men with TART exhibited higher T (14.0 ± 0.80 nmol/L) than those without (11.9 ± 0.71 nmol/L). During the observation period, T levels rose in both groups but more in men with TART (from 10.1 ± 1.1 to 17.3 ± 1.9 nmol/L vs 10.3 ± 1.0 to 12.8 ± 1.9 nmol/L); this was accompanied by rising luteinizing hormone and diminishing hydrocortisone equivalent dosages (TART: from 38.1 ± 3.2 to 35.1 ± 1.8 mg/d; vs no TART: 28.8 ± 2.7 to 28.1 ± 1.6 mg/d) without correlation with any markers of adrenal androgen control. Inhibin B declined in men with large TART over time while TART status remained stable. T levels below the normal range are frequent in men with 21OHD, regardless of TART, but change little over time. Besides adrenal androgen control gonadal axis suppression from supraphysiological glucocorticoid dosages needs to be considered. While our results do not endorse regular screening for alterations in TART status among adults, Sertoli cell function should be monitored in men with large TART.","Matthias K Auer, Duygu Büyükerzurmulu, Christian Lottspeich, Martin Bidlingmaier, Eva Rieger, Hanna Nowotny, Lea Tschaidse, Richard J Auchus, Nicole Reisch","European journal of endocrinology","2024Aug30","Humans; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Adult; Adrenal Rest Tumor; Retrospective Studies; Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital; Testosterone; Prevalence; Inhibins; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Luteinizing Hormone"

Weight concern was associated with DBP (0·06 (95 % CI 0·02, 0·10)), triglyceride (0·06 (95 % CI 0·02, 0·10)) and HDL-cholesterol (-0·10 (95 % CI -0·14, -0·07)). Higher scores on DE characteristics were associated with higher BMI, and higher BMI was further associated with lower HDL-cholesterol and higher other CMR. In summary, we observed significant associations between shape and weight concerns with some CMR in Chinese women, and these associations were potentially partially mediated by BMI. Our findings suggest that prevention and intervention strategies focusing on addressing DE could potentially help reduce the burden of CMR in China, possibly through controlling BMI.","Baiyu Qi, Gabrielle E Cooper, Laura M Thornton, Ruyue Zhang, Shuyang Yao, Annie Green Howard, Penny Gordon-Larsen, Shufa Du, Huijun Wang, Bing Zhang, Cynthia M Bulik, Kari E North, Melissa A Munn-Chernoff","The British journal of nutrition","2024Sep23",NA
"39308158","Looking Beyond the Number of Repetitions: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study on Calf Raise Test Outcomes in Children Aged 10-17 Years.","The calf raise test (CRT) assesses plantarflexor strength and endurance, but normative data for children are scarce. Furthermore, contradictions exist on which factors are associated with total repetitions, with repetitions being the only metric considered. We quantified three of the main CRT outcomes (repetitions, total work, and peak height) in children 10-17 years and explored their relationship with various factors. Healthy children (n = 165, 50.3% female) completed single-legged calf raises on a 10° incline, once on each leg. Test outcomes were extracted using the valid and reliable Calf Raise application. CRT outcomes were not significantly different between legs (p ≥ .19). The only covariates significantly associated with outcomes based on stepwise quantile regressions were body mass index centile for repetitions, meeting physical activity recommendations for total work and peak height, and age for total work. Outcomes did not significantly differ based on sex or maturation. Median values were around 26 for repetitions, 640-1460 J for total work (age dependent), and 10.1 cm for peak height for children meeting physical activity recommendations. Children who were older, had lower body mass indices, and were more active exhibited superior CRT outcomes. Meeting physical activity recommendations appears beneficial for plantarflexor function and should continue to be prioritized in children.","Kim Hébert-Losier, Yash Pandit, Oliver W A Wilson, Jenny Clarke","Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics","2024Sep23",NA

From August to October 2020, 1929 Tibetan students were selected from 12 primary and secondary schools in Lhasa City to conduct questionnaire surveys on demographic characteristics, smoking, drinking, living habits, and food consumption frequency, and physical examinations such as height, weight and blood pressure measurements. The association between BMI and blood pressure was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression model and linear regression model. A total of 843 boys(43.70%)and 1086 girls(56.30%)were surveyed, with an average age of(14.25±2.71) years old.925 people(47.95%)were in urban areas and 1004 people(52.05%)were in rural areas. There were 726 people(37.64%)inprimary school students, 692 people(35.87%)in junior high school, 363 people(18.82%)in high school, and 148 people(7.67%)in vocational high school. There were 541 people(28.05%)who were emaciated, 183 people(9.49%)who were overweight, and 87 people(4.51%)who were obese. The wasting, overweight and obesity rates of Tibetan primary and secondary school students were 28.05%, 9.49% and 4.51%, respectively. The high blood pressure rate was 8.76%. The BMI value of the high blood pressure group of students was higher than that of the students in the normal blood pressure group, and the difference was statistically significant(t=4.63, P&lt;0.05). The result of the multi-factor logistic regression model showed that among the study subjects, the risk of high blood pressure, high systolic blood pressure, and high diastolic blood pressure were 3.07 times higher than those of people with normal BMI(95% CI 1.71-5.51, P&lt;0.01), 2.83 times(95% CI 1.38-5.81, P&lt;0.01), 4.19 times(95% CI 2.11-8.32, P&lt;0.01).

The relationship between IR, HUA, and RPL has not been thoroughly investigated. This study investigates the relationship between four IR surrogates and the risk of HUA in RPL patients. Data from a real-world study on RPL in China were analyzed using multivariable regression to determine the relationship between HUA and triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index, triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-c) ratio, and metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR). The predictive ability of these surrogates for detecting HUA in RPL patients was evaluated using the area under the curve and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed using bootstrapping resampling. The study included 769 patients with a mean age of 30 ± 4 years old, 8.32% of whom had HUA. Four IR surrogates were closely related to HUA in patients of RPL after adjusting for age, menstrual cycle, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total cholesterol, homocysteine, and low-density lipoprotein, with area under the curve values of TyG index (OR = 0.693, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.626, 0.759), TyG-BMI (OR = 0.731 95% CI: 0.657, 0.805), TG/HDL-C (OR = 0.703, 95% CI: 0.641, 0.764), and METS-IR (OR = 0.728, 95% CI: 0.655, 0.799). Bootstrap resampling yielded similar results. The TyG index, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL-c, and METS-IR significantly correlated with HUA in patients with RPL.

"39307897","Impact of Body Mass Index and VO2 Max on Symptoms, Physical Activity, and Physical Function in a Multinational Sample of People with HIV.","People with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk for metabolic disorders affecting body mass index (BMI), chronic symptoms, and impaired physical function and capacity. Although physical activity improves health and well-being, PWH often do not meet activity recommendations necessary to achieve these benefits. Despite the known impact of symptoms, physical activity, and physical function on health, little is known about the relationships and interactions between these variables and BMI and maximum oxygen consumption during exercise (VO2 max) in a multinational population of PWH. We examined the relationship of BMI with PROMIS-29 measures, physical activity, strength, flexibility, and VO2 max in a diverse sample of PWH. Additionally, we examined the relationship of VO2 max with PROMIS-29 measures. Data from 810 PWH who participated in a cross-sectional study conducted by the International Nursing Network for HIV Research (Study VII) were analyzed. Participants were recruited from 8 sites across the United States, Thailand, and South Africa. BMI was calculated from collected height and weight data. Physical function and symptoms were assessed using the PROMIS-29 measure. Physical activity was assessed using the 7-day Physical Activity Recall. VO2 max was calculated using sex at birth, age, BMI and the 6-minute Walk Test. Data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational, and regression statistical analyses. Participants had an average age of 49.1 (± 11.1) years, 44% were female, and the average BMI of the sample group was 27 kg/m2 (± 6.7). Increased BMI was associated with decreased 6-minute Walk Test (β=-2.18, p < 0.001), flexibility (β=-0.279, p < 0.001), and VO2 max (β=-0.598, p < 0.001), even after controlling for covariates (age, sex at birth, country, years living with HIV, and antiretroviral therapy status). BMI was not associated with self-reported physical activity. Increased VO2 max was associated with increased physical function (β = 0.069, p < 0.001), and decreased pain (β=-0.047, p < 0.006), even after controlling for covariates (country, years living with HIV, and antiretroviral therapy status). Future research should explore development of effective and sustainable symptom self-management interventions in PWH accounting for the potential impact of BMI and VO2 max.","Christine Horvat Davey, Deepesh Duwadi, J Craig Phillips, Carol Dawson-Rose, Kathleen M Nokes, Joseph Perazzo, Allison R Webel","AIDS and behavior","2024Sep23",NA

The patients were categorized into COPD Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 groups according to the severity of lung function. Based on the fat-free mass index (FFMI), patients were categorized into a low FFMI group (FFMI<17 kg/m2) and a normal FFMI group (FFMI≥17 kg/m2). Based on phase angle (PhA), patients were categorized into the low PhA group (PhA<5°) and the normal PhA group (PhA≥5°). Based on 6MWD, patients were divided into impaired endurance group (6MWD<350 m) and normal endurance group (6MWD≥350 m). Differences in body composition indexes, exercise capacity, and nutritional status of patients in different subgroups were compared. A trend test was used to analyze the trend of GOLD grading and body composition indexes. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of FFMI, PhA, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and visceral fat index (VFI) with 6MWD, HGS, post-diastolic exertional expiratory volume in the first second as a percentage of exertional lung capacity (FEV1%pred), and body mass index (BMI). Results: The age of 90 male COPD patients was 66 (59, 71) years. FFMI, PhA, SMI, BMR, VFI, HGS, and 6MWD tended to decrease with increasing GOLD levels (all P<0.05).

Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. Patients were divided into non-obese (NO) and obese cohorts according to their BMI. Outcomes were compared between the two groups subsequently. A total of 264 patients, 96 obese and 168 NO were included. Patients with obesity were younger (72.8 ± 6.9 vs 76 ± 7.3 years, P< 0.001) but had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (27.1% vs 12%, P= 0.01) and dyslipidemia (80.2% vs 68.5%, P=0.03). Both cohorts had similar rates of percutaneous access (37.5% for obese vs 35.1%, P=0.7), and no significant differences in the rate of conversion to open access (8.3% for obese vs 4.2%, P=0.16). Technical success was similar between the cohorts (89% for obese vs 86%, P=0.59). Major adverse events (MAEs) were higher in the NO group (13.1% vs 4.2%, P= 0.02). Patients in the obese cohort suffered more access site related infections (7.3% vs 1.2%, P= 0.01). All-cause mortality over 5 years was significant higher in the NO group (35.1% vs 21.9%, P= 0.02). No statistical differences were found in spinal cord injury or dialysis requirement rates. Furthermore, on follow-up at 5 years, endoleak, branch instability, and reintervention rates were not statistically different between the two cohorts. Patients with obesity are on average younger, however, were more likely to suffer access site infections compared to non-obese patients. They had increased survival rates on follow-up although rates of reinterventions and endoleaks were similar between the two cohorts. Our study demonstrates that despite higher comorbidities, patients with obesity had similar intraoperative success with reduced post operative mortality, however access site infections remains a significant clinical concern.","Hesham Alghofili, Daniyal N Mahmood, KongTeng Tan, Thomas F Lindsay","Journal of vascular surgery","2024Sep20",NA
"39307428","Type 2 diabetes mellitus modifies and mediates the association between the visceral adiposity index and depression: A cross-sectional study using NHANES 2005-2018 data.","The objective of this investigation was to explore the correlation between the visceral adiposity index (VAI) and depression, and to analyze how type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may influence this relationship. This study included data of 12,378 participants sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018. Utilizing multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, we examined the correlation between VAI and depression. Additionally, we investigated the interactive and mediating effects of T2DM on the association between VAI and depression. Controlling for all potential confounders, the Ln logarithmic transformation of VAI showed a significant positive correlation with depression [odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.35, P = 0.041]. T2DM exhibited a notable interaction effect on the relationship connecting lnVAI and depression (P for interaction = 0.013). Specifically, the T2DM group exhibited a notable positive correlation between lnVAI and depression (OR = 1.46, 95 % CI: 1.17-1.82, P < 0.001), whereas such correlation didn't reach statistical significance within the non-T2DM group. The RCS model revealed a J-shaped nonlinear link between lnVAI and depression, with an inflection point value of 0.052. Mediation analysis indicated that diabetes accounted for 8.0 % of the correlation between lnVAI and depression. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistency of these findings. A J-shaped nonlinear dose-response relationship was observed between lnVAI and depression among American adults, with a threshold of 0.052. T2DM not only served as a mediator between the two variables but also modified their association.","Yujun Zhang, Jingjing Song, Benjie Li, Xinmeng Lv, Jiahao Liu, Wei Si, Xin Huang, Jiazhen Tang, Xiaorong Yang, Fang Liu","Journal of affective disorders","2024Sep20",NA
"39307279","Intake of Added Sugar from Different Sources and Risk of All-cause Mortality and Cardiovascular Diseases: The Role of Body Mass Index.","Recent studies have shown an ascending trend in global added sugar consumption. Evidence for the long-term consequences of added sugar from different sources on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains limited. This study aimed to examine the associations between added sugar from various sources and the risk of all-cause mortality and CVDs, and to determine whether genetic predisposition and body mass index (BMI) influence or mediate these associations. We included 196,414 UK Biobank participants who completed a 24-hour food survey between 2009 and 2012. Sugar contents were collected from the Composition of Foods Integrated Dataset (CoFID). The National Death Registries and hospital records provided data on death and the disease diagnosis. We employed a polygenic risk score (PRS) to assess the genetic predisposition. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the associations. Totally, 10,081 deaths, 38,563 hypertension cases, 12,306 ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), and 5,491 cerebrovascular diseases were documented. Compared with the lowest quartile group of added sugar intake, the hazards ratios for all-cause mortality in the highest quartile were 1.21 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.30) for total added sugar, 1.03(95% CI: 0.97, 1.10) for solids, and 1.16(95% CI: 1.10, 1.23) for beverages. For CVDs, significant associations were observed in total added sugar and beverage sources. These associations were not altered by PRS, and individuals at greatest risk showed higher PRS along with excessive added sugar consumption (Ptrend<0.001). BMI was found to mediate the highest proportion of the association between added sugar and hypertension (19.10% for total; 36.95% for beverages). Higher intake of added sugar, especially from beverages, is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVDs. BMI mediates a proportion of these associations.","Ziwei Shi, Wenmin Zhu, Zhiqun Lei, Xiaolong Yan, Xinyue Zhang, Sheng Wei, Qi Wang","The Journal of nutrition","2024Sep20",NA
"39307242","What is the best mode of delivery in nulliparous, singleton, term, vertex pregnancies of individuals ≥ 35 years old?: Short title: What is the best mode of delivery in nulliparous, singleton, term, vertex pregnancies?","With approximately 145 million births occurring worldwide each year - over 30 million by cesarean delivery, the need for evaluation of maternal and perinatal outcomes in different delivery scenarios is more pressing than ever. Recently, in a meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs), planned cesarean delivery was associated with decreased rates of low umbilical artery pH, and neonatal complications such as birth trauma, tube feeding, and hypotonia when compared to planned vaginal delivery. Among singleton pregnancies, planned cesarean delivery was associated with a lower rate of perinatal death. For mothers, planned cesarean delivery was associated with significantly less chorioamnionitis, more wound infection, and less urinary incontinence at 1-2 years. Conversely, planned vaginal delivery has been associated with benefits such as a lower incidence of wound infection and quicker postpartum recovery compared to planned cesarean delivery. Nonetheless, several risk factors for cesarean delivery are increasing - such as older maternal age, obesity, diabetes, excessive gestational weight gain, and birth weight - while maternal pelvises are getting smaller. Concerns about the potential long-term risks of multiple cesarean deliveries, such as placenta accreta spectrum disorders, highlight the need for a balanced evaluation of both delivery modes. However, the total fertility rate is decreasing in the US and around the world, with many people wanting two or fewer babies, which decreases future risk of placenta accreta incurred by multiple cesarean deliveries in these individuals. Furthermore, one in four obstetricians-gynecologists has undergone a cesarean delivery on maternal request for their nulliparous, singleton, term, vertex (NSTV) pregnancy, and cesarean delivery rates less than about 19% have been associated with higher perinatal and maternal mortality. Thus, we propose that it is imperative that we prioritize conducting randomized trials to compare planned cesarean to planned vaginal delivery for NSTV pregnancies. Such trials would need to include 8,000 or more individuals; they would ideally follow each participant to the end of their reproductive life and study perinatal and maternal outcomes, including non-biologic outcomes such as patient satisfaction, postpartum depression, breastfeeding rates, mother-infant bonding, post-traumatic stress, and cost-effectiveness. The time for such a trial is now, as it holds the potential to inform and improve obstetrical care practices globally.","Vincenzo Berghella, Victoria Adewale, Tanvi Rana, Giulia Bonanni, Suneet P Chauhan, Federica Bellussi, Dwight Rouse, Jon Barrett","American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM","2024Sep20",NA
"39307096","Lipidomic perturbations of normal-weight adiposity phenotypes and their mediations on diet-adiposity associations.","Normal-weight obesity (NWO) and normal-weight central obesity (NWCO) have been linked to higher cardiometabolic risks, but their etiological bases and attributable dietary factors remain unclear. In this study we therefore aimed to identify lipidomic signatures and dietary factors related to NWO and NWCO and to explore the mediation associations of lipids in diet-adiposity associations. Using a high-coverage targeted lipidomic approach, we quantified 1245 serum lipids in participants with NWO (n = 150), NWCO (n = 150), or propensity-score-matched normal-weight controls (n = 150) based on the Regional Ethnic Cohort Study in Northwest China. Consumption frequency of 28 major food items was recorded using a food frequency questionnaire. Profound lipidomic perturbations of NWCO relative to NWO were observed, and 249 (dominantly glycerolipids) as well as 48 (dominantly glycerophospholipids) lipids were exclusively associated with NWCO or NWO. Based on strong lipidomic signatures identified by a LASSO model, phospholipid biosynthesis was the top enriched pathway of NWCO, and sphingolipid metabolism was the top pathway of NWO. Remarkably, sphingolipids were positively associated with NWO and NWCO, but lyso-phosphatidylcholines were negatively associated with them. Rice, fruit juice, and carbonated drink intakes were positively associated with the risk of NWCO. Both global and individual lipidomic signatures, including SE(28:1_22:6) and HexCer(d18:1/20:1), mediated these diet-NWCO associations (mediation proportion: 15.92%-26.10%). Differential lipidomic signatures were identified for overall and abdominal adiposity accumulation in normal-weight individuals, underlining their core mediation roles in dietary contributions to adiposity deposition.","Kun Xu, Yuan Shen, Lin Shi, Fangyao Chen, Binyan Zhang, Yafang He, Yutong Wang, Yezhou Liu, Guoshuai Shi, Baibing Mi, Lingxia Zeng, Shaonong Dang, Xin Liu, Hong Yan","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","2024Sep17",NA
"39307074","Osteosarcopenia predicts greater risk of functional disability than sarcopenia: a longitudinal analysis of FraDySMex cohort study.","Aging involves significant changes in body composition, marked by declines in muscle mass and bone mineral density alongside an increase in fat mass. Sarcopenia is characterized by low strength and muscle mass, and osteosarcopenia is the coexistence of sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Physiologically, there is a crosstalk between muscle and bone tissues mediated by several pathways. Both, sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia, have been related with adverse outcomes such as functional disability. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia phenotypes increased the risk of functional disability in a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling adults. This study constitutes a secondary longitudinal analysis of data derived from the prospective cohort FraDySMex (Frailty, Dynapenia, and Sarcopenia in Mexican adults). FraDySMex is conducted in community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or older living in Mexico City. Data from 2014 to 2015 was considered as baseline evaluation, and the 2019 wave was the follow-up evaluation. Individuals with complete baseline and follow-up evaluations were included in the analysis. Sarcopenia diagnosis adhered to the FNIH criteria, while osteopenia/osteoporosis classification followed WHO guidelines. Osteosarcopenia was defined as the concurrent presence of sarcopenia and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Functional disability was identified by the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale. Adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models were estimated to evaluate the effect of body composition phenotype on the risk of functional disability. The final sample included 320 adults with complete longitudinal data. The majority of were women (83.4%) and had 7-12 years of education (48.4%). At the baseline evaluation, 50.9% aged 50-70. The osteosarcopenia phenotype was associated with a higher risk of functional disability (OR: 2.17, p = 0.042) compared with the no osteopenia/sarcopenia group. Conversely, sarcopenia (OR: 1.50, p = 0.448) and osteopenia/osteoporosis (OR: 1.50, p = 0.185) phenotypes were not associated with functional disability. Our study underscores that osteosarcopenia significantly increased the risk of functional disability, particularly in terms of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). These results emphasize the importance of screening for sarcopenia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and osteosarcopenia across various clinical settings. Early detection and intervention hold promise for averting functional disability and mitigating associated adverse outcomes in adults.","Oscar Rosas-Carrasco, Betty Manrique-Espinoza, Juan Carlos López-Alvarenga, Beatriz Mena-Montes, Isabel Omaña-Guzmán","The journal of nutrition, health & aging","2024Sep21",NA
"39307005","Clinical effectiveness of medical marijuana in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Following legalization, Medical Marijuana (MM), has been used to treat the symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), yet data regarding Medical Marijuana's efficacy is lacking. Thus, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess Medical Marijuana's impact on ALS symptoms and progression. We reviewed the charts of all ALS patients treated in our clinic over a two-year period to collect data related to the primary outcome measures of symptoms of pain, poor appetite, anxiety, spasticity, insomnia, ALSFRS-R score, BMI, and MM use. Two groups were defined: a control group with target symptoms but no MM prescription, and a test group that filled a MM prescription, including a subgroup on MM for ≥3 visits. Outcomes were correlations between MM usage and symptom prevalence, and between MM usage and BMI and ALSFRS-R decline slope, analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis via local regression. Data included 344 ALS patients. We found MM use correlated with alleviation of pain, poor appetite, and anxiety in the short term, but not with spasticity or insomnia. There was no correlation between MM use BMI maintenance. Notably, MM usage correlated with faster ALS progression, although patients using MM exhibited higher symptom burden and progressed faster than controls even pre-MM prescription. In conclusion, MM shows correlation with managing pain, poor appetite, and short-term anxiety in ALS, but is also correlated with faster disease progression based on ALSFRS-R scores. We suggest a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate both the clinical efficacy and safety of MM in the treatment of ALS.","John Michael Austin, Ryan Bailey, Sandra Garcia Velazquez, Harinandan Sainath, Carlayne Jackson","Journal of the neurological sciences","2024Sep16",NA
"39306956","Structured respiratory physiotherapy protocol for resolution of atelectasis in pediatric intensive care.","Children are at higher risk of atelectasis due to their anatomical and physiological particularities. Several physiotherapy techniques are used to treat atelectasis, but only four studies cite methods in pediatric patients undergoing Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV). The objective of this study was to evaluate the Structured Respiratory Physiotherapy Protocol (SRPP) for airway clearance and lung reexpansion for infants on IMV with atelectasis. This is a prospective study including 30 infants (mean ± standard deviation age 8.9 ± 8.0 months; weight 7.5 ± 3.0 kg; BMI 15.8 ± 1.6 kg/cm2 and IMV duration 7.7 ± 4.3 days). The sample was randomized into a Control Group (CG), which received routine physiotherapy, and an Intervention Group (IG), submitted to SRPP (postural drainage, mechanical thoracic vibration, manual hyperinflation, stretching of the accessory respiratory muscles, and functional positioning). Both groups were evaluated before and after physiotherapy for respiratory effort using the Wood Downes Score (WD) and pulmonary aeration using lung ultrasonography (Lung Ultrasound Score ‒ LUS). The outcome of the intervention was evaluated by the magnitude of the effect by the Hedges' g test [(small (0.2 < Hedges' g < 0.5), moderate (0.5 < Hedges' g < 0.8) and large (Hedges' g > 0.8) effects]. There were large within-group effects on the reduction of WD in the CG after intervention in both the CG (Hedges' g = -1.53) and IG (Hedges' g = -2.2). There was a moderate effect on LUS reduction in the CG (Hedges' g = -0.64) and a large effect on IG (Hedges' g = -1.88). This study has shown that the SRPP appears to be safe and may be effective in improving airway clearance and lung reexpansion in children on IMV with atelectasis.","Patrícia Aparecida Silva Camassuti, Cíntia Johnston, Werther Brunow de Carvalho, Michele Luglio, Orlei Ribeiro de Araújo, Brenda Morrow","Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","2024","Humans; Pulmonary Atelectasis; Prospective Studies; Infant; Female; Male; Respiratory Therapy; Respiration, Artificial; Treatment Outcome; Physical Therapy Modalities; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Lung; Clinical Protocols"
"39306876","Glycogenic hepatopathy associated with hepatic steatosis in type 1 diabetes.","Glycogenic hepatopathy is associated with significant psychosocial consequences and health costs. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease and glycogenic hepatopathy are frequently confused as ""fatty liver"" when seen on ultrasonography. We wished to examine liver fat and glycogen content in groups defined based on metabolic and liver disease phenotypes. This case-control study undertaken in a tertiary hospital used nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to examine liver fat and glycogen content in five clinical groups, each containing five participants: 1. type 1 diabetes with glycogenic hepatopathy, 2. satisfactorily controlled type 1 diabetes with no liver disease, 3. poorly controlled type 1 diabetes without liver disease, 4. a control group of body mass index- and age-matched individuals without diabetes or liver disease, and 5. hepatic steatosis. Fat content was highest in the hepatic steatosis (median 15.4 %, IQR 10.0-19.3) and glycogenic hepatopathy (median 6.5 %, IQR 4.5-9.1) groups and compared to both of these groups was lower in the control group (median 1.0 %, IQR 0.7-1.1, p 0.002 and 0.022), the T1DM group with satisfactory control (median 0.3 %, IQR 0.2-0.6, p < 0.001 and <0.001), and the T1DM group with poor control without liver disease (median 1.1 %, IQR 0.9-1.1, p 0.001 and 0.012). No participants from the type 1 diabetes poor control, type 1 diabetes satisfactory control or the no diabetes groups had 1H-MRS-diagnosed hepatic steatosis. 1H-MRS glycogen content could not be interpreted in the majority of those with glycogenic hepatopathy because of interference from the fat signal. In cases diagnosed with glycogenic hepatopathy there may be significant concomitant fat accumulation, compounding the already elevated cardiovascular risk in this cohort. The technique of 1H-MRS has not been demonstrated to be useful for diagnosing glycogenic hepatopathy.","Stephanie Teasdale, Xin Dong, Alison Griffin, Paul James Clark, Janelle Nisbet, Adam Morton, Liza Phillips, Mitchell Anthony Sullivan, Graham Galloway","Journal of diabetes and its complications","2024Sep17",NA

A total of 90 subjects, of mean age 46.7 ± 10.5 years and mean BMI of 32.0 ± 6.3 kg/m2 were enrolled. They were divided into 3 groups: 19 with NGT, 22 with NGT and 1hrOGTT > 8.6 mmol/l, and 49 with IGT; and subdivided into 2 subgroups according to HOMA-IR: 40 with HOMA-IR < 2.5 and 50 with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5. Body composition (Inbody 720) and advanced glycation end products (AGE Reader) were assessed. Two functional tests (OGTT; MMTT) were performed and AUC for glucose, insulin and triglycerides were calculated. There was no difference across the glucose tolerance groups for all evaluated lipids. The results showed higher AUCinsulin during OGTT (p = 0.037 and 0.020), AUCtriglycerides during MMTT (p = 0.048) and triglycerides/HDL ratio (p = 0.064 and 0.016) in the 1hrOGTT and IGT subgroups with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5 in comparison to those with HOMA-IR < 2.5. AUCtriglycerides during OGTT is independently related to body composition, b-cell function and insulin sensitivity; and AUCtriglycerides during MMTT is independently related to blood pressure and hsCRP in prediabetes. Triglycerides/HDL-C ratio emerged as an independent contributor to glycaemia and insulinemia. Our results demonstrate a similar lipid profile in subjects with 1hrOGTT > 8.6 mmol/l and IGT, whereas increased AUCtriglycerides during OGTT, AUCtriglycerides during MMTT and triglycerides/HDL-C ratio have been found in the subgroups with insulin resistance. The triglycerides/HDL-C ratio outlined as an independent predictor of insulin secretion and action, and postload triglycerides appear to be independently related to most of the metabolic parameters.","Rumyana Dimova, Nevena Chakarova, Mina Serdarova, Tsvetalina Tankova","Journal of diabetes and its complications","2024Sep18",NA

"39306824","Chondrocyte Ferritinophagy as a Molecular Mechanism of Arthritis-A Narrative Review.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease affecting orthopedic patients. Its incidence is steadily increasing, causing great economic hardship for individuals and society as a whole. OA is connected with risk factors such as genetics, obesity, and joint diseases; yet, its pathophysiology is still largely understood. At present, several cell death pathways govern the initiation and advancement of OA. It has been discovered that the onset and progression of OA are strongly associated with pyroptosis, senescence, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Ferroptosis and autophagy have not been well studied in OA, and elucidating their molecular mechanisms in chondrocytes is important for the diagnosis of OA. For this reason, we aim was reviewed recent national and international developments and provided an initial understanding of the molecular pathways underlying autophagy and ferroptosis in OA. We determined the reference period to be the last five years by searching for the keywords ""osteoarthritis, mechanical stress, Pizeo1, ferroptosis, autophagy, ferritin autophagy"" in the three databases of PUBMED, Web of Science, Google Scholar. We then screened irrelevant literature by reading the abstracts. Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is dependent on reactive oxygen species and Fe2+. It is primarily caused by processes linked to amino acid metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and iron metabolism. Furthermore, Piezoelectric mechanically sensitive ion channel assembly 1 (PIEZO1), which is triggered by mechanical stress, has been revealed to be intimately associated with ferroptosis events. It was found that mechanical injury triggers changes in the intracellular environment of articular chondrocytes (e.g., elevated levels of oxidative stress and increased inflammation) through PIEZO1, ultimately leading to iron death in chondrocytes. Therefore, we believe that PIEZO1 is a key initiator protein of iron death in chondrocytes. Widely present in eukaryotic cells, autophagy is a lysosome-dependent, evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that carries misfolded proteins, damaged organelles, and other macromolecules to lysosomes for breakdown and recycling. Throughout OA, autophagy is activated to differing degrees, indicating that autophagy may play a role in the development of OA. According to recent research, autophagy is a major factor in the process that leads cells to ferroptosis. Despite the notion of ferritinophagy being put forth, not much research has been done to clarify the connection between ferroptosis and autophagy in OA.","Yong Liu, Chao Song, Silong Gao, Daqian Zhou, Jiale Lv, Yang Zhou, Liquan Wang, Houyin Shi, Fei Liu, Zhongwei Xiong, Yunqing Hou, Zongchao Liu","Cell biochemistry and biophysics","2024Sep22",NA

In this large cohort study (UMIN-ID: UMIN000033529), we retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data from consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic or open surgery for pathological stage II-III colon cancer between 2009 and 2013. A comparative analysis was performed after propensity score matching between the laparoscopic and open surgery groups. The primary endpoint was the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS). We identified 1575 eligible patients from 46 institutions. Each group comprised 526 propensity score-matched patients. Comparing the laparoscopic versus open surgery group, laparoscopic surgery was significantly associated with increased median operating time (225 vs. 192.5 min; P < .0001) and decreased median estimated blood loss (20 vs. 140 ml; P < .0001).

We aimed to describe the interaction between fetal and infant growth and their association with and ability to predict childhood overweight. We used routinely collected fetal growth data from Aarhus University Hospital and child growth data from Aarhus Municipality, 2008-2018. The outcome was overweight at age 5-9 years. The fetal growth rates at weeks 28 and 34 were extracted from individual trajectories using mixed models. We identified patterns of infant BMI Z-score growth using latent class analysis and estimated odds ratios of overweight at age 5-9 years dependent on fetal and infant growth. Predictive capabilities were assessed by comparing areas under the ROC-curves (AUCROC) of the prediction models. In 6206 children, we identified three infancy growth patterns: average, accelerated, and decelerated growth. We found 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.12) greater odds of being overweight for every 10 g/week increase in fetal growth rate at week 34. Compared with average growth, accelerated infant growth was associated with 1.52 (95% CI: 1.20-1.90) greater odds of overweight. Combining fetal and infant growth, children with average fetal growth and accelerated infant growth had 1.96 (95% CI: 1.41-2.73) greater odds of overweight. Fast fetal growth with decelerated infant growth was not associated with being overweight (OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.98)), showing that infant growth modified the association between fetal growth and overweight. When fetal growth was added to a prediction model containing known risk factors, the AUCROC remained unchanged but infant growth improved the predictive capability (AUCROC difference: 0.04 (95% CI: 0.03-0.06)). Fetal and infant growth were independently associated with overweight, but distinct combinations of fetal and infant growth showed marked differences in risk.

Utilising the NHANES data, this cross-sectional study provides insights into the American population aged 20-49 years. The study includes 4608 participants from the NHANES 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 cycles, focusing on those with complete data on HSV infection and hearing assessment. The study analyses the association between HSV (types 1 and 2) infection and hearing loss, using weighted multivariate regression for statistical evaluations. We observed an association between HSV-1 infection and an increased likelihood of hearing impairment (OR, 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9)). A similar association was noted for those coinfected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 (OR, 1.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3)). Similarly, higher grades of hearing loss and elevated pure-tone averages were more prevalent in these groups. Notably, the association between HSV-1 and hearing impairment was more pronounced in individuals aged 20-34 (OR, 2.1 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.3); P for interaction=0.020) and those with a body mass index (BMI) below 30 (OR, 1.8 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.8); P for interaction=0.028). Our findings suggest an association between HSV-1 infection or coinfections with HSV-1 and HSV-2 and the presence of hearing impairment. The association appears particularly pronounced among younger individuals and those with a lower BMI. Further prospective research is needed to explore the causal impact of HSV on auditory function.","Yingqiang Li, Bo Su, Xiaodi Wang, Hanqi Chu, Dan Bing","BMJ open","2024Sep20","Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Hearing Loss; Herpes Simplex; Nutrition Surveys; United States; Young Adult; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Herpesvirus 2, Human; Risk Factors; Multivariate Analysis; Coinfection"

The pathophysiology of CKD in HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is not well defined. In this study we compared clinical and proteomic profiles of CKD between patients with HFrEF and HFpEF. We included 478 patients of the Scottish BIOSTAT-CHF cohort, of which 246 had HFrEF and 232 had HFpEF. CKD was defined as an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. We compared HFrEF-patients with CKD to HFpEF-patients with CKD using logistic- and Cox-regression. We performed a differential expression analysis using 6376 proteins. The prevalence of CKD was 36 % and 32 % in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively. CKD patients were on average 7 years older. BMI, higher NT-proBNP, ACE-inhibitors, HDL-cholesterol and Stroke were associated with CKD- patients with HFrEF. In HFpEF, CKD was associated with MRA-use and higher platelet count. CKD was associated with increased risk of death or heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.82, p < 0.001), with similar effect in HFrEF and HFpEF. The pattern of differentially expressed proteins between patients with and without CKD was similar in both HF-groups. Clinical profiles related to CKD- patients with HFrEF were different from CKD-patients with HFrEF. CKD was associated with an increased risk of death or heart failure hospitalization, which was not different between HFpEF and HFrEF. Patterns of circulating proteins were similar between CKD-patients with HFpEF and HFrEF, suggesting no major differences in CKD-pathophysiology.","Geert H D Voordes, Adriaan A Voors, Annabelle Hoegl, Christian T Madsen, Bart J van Essen, Wouter Ouwerkerk, Jasper Tromp, Mark A de la Rambelje, Mads Grønborg, Jan C Refsgaard, Chim C Lang, Natasha Barascuk-Michaelsen, Kevin Damman","International journal of cardiology","2024Sep19",NA
"39306218","Production, analysis, and safety assessment of a soil and plant-based natural material with microbiome- and immune-modulatory effects.","It has been suggested that reduced contact with microbiota from the natural environment contributes to the rising incidence of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs) in western, highly urbanized societies. In line with this, we have previously shown that exposure to environmental microbiota in the form of a blend comprising of soil and plant-based material (biodiversity blend; BDB) enhances the diversity of human commensal microbiota and promotes immunoregulation that may be associated with a reduced risk for IMIDs. To provide a framework for future preclinical studies and clinical trials, this study describes how the preparation of BDB was standardized, its microbial content analysed and safety assessments performed. Multiple batches of BDB were manufactured and microbial composition analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed a consistently high alpha diversity and relative abundance of bacteria normally found in soil and vegetation. We also found that inactivation of BDB by autoclaving effectively inactivates human and murine bacteria, viruses and parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that experimental mice prone to develop IMIDs (non-obese diabetic, NOD, mouse model) can be exposed to BDB without causing adverse effects on animal health and welfare. Our study provides insights into a potentially safe, sustainable, and cost-effective approach for simulating exposure to natural microbiota, which could have substantial impacts on health and socio-economic factors.","Anirudra Parajuli, Iida Mäkelä, Marja I Roslund, Emma Ringqvist, Juulia Manninen, Yan Sun, Noora Nurminen, Sami Oikarinen, Olli H Laitinen, Heikki Hyöty, Malin Flodström-Tullberg, Aki Sinkkonen","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","2024Sep19",NA

In vitro and in vivo transfection with pDL-EV71 driven by the CMV promoter successfully yielded fully infectious EV71. More importantly, the administration of pDL-EV71 did not cause clinical symptoms following intracranial or intramuscular inoculation in neonatal and IFNα/βR-/- mice, demonstrating its safety profile. Moreover, a single-dose or two-dose immunization with pDL-EV71 elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against EV71 as well as an antigen-specific cellular response in mice. A single-dose immunization with 10 μg of pDL-EV71 conferred complete protection against lethal EV71 infection in neonates born to immunized maternal mice.

"39306087","The Physical Home Food Environment in Relation to Children's Diet Quality and Cardiometabolic Health.","Home food availability has been identified as an important influence on dietary intake. Less is known about the relationship between the physical home food environment (HFE) and factors of cardiometabolic health in children. The purpose was to explore the relationship between the physical HFE and diet quality and factors of cardiometabolic health (weight, blood biomarkers). This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis with one or more children per household. This study included 44 children aged 6-12 years old from 29 households in the Newark, DE, area between August 2020 to August 2021. The Home Food Inventory provides an obesogenic score (score indicative of the presence of energy-dense foods) for the overall HFE and HFE subcategories scores; z-BMI scores were calculated using measured height and weight; diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 total scores; and cardiometabolic biomarkers were obtained from serum blood samples. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed model regressions were used to test the association between the physical HFE and each of the outcome variables: z-BMI, HEI-2020, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. HFE subcategories (e.g., fruits and vegetables (FV)) were also examined with each outcome using linear mixed model regression. Children were 9.5±1.9 years with 61.4% female, 59.1% identifying as White, and 90.9% non-Hispanic. Obesogenic score was significantly associated with z-BMI (b=0.03, p=0.029), but not HEI-2020 or cardiometabolic biomarkers. As HFE FV subcategory increased HEI-2020 significantly increased (β=0.73, p=0.005) while total-cholesterol (β=-1.54, p=0.014) and LDL-cholesterol levels (β=-1.31, p=0.010) significantly decreased. Increased availability of sweet and salty snack food and availability of sugar sweetened beverages was associated with increased fasting blood glucose (β=0.65, p=0.033) and insulin levels (β=5.60, p=0.035) respectively.

Long-term, single arm studies show durable outcomes, but there is limited comparative data to Nissen (NF). We performed a retrospective propensity matched cohort study of patients with GERD undergoing MSA or NF between 2012 and 2018. Patients were matched on age, gender, BMI, size of hiatal hernia, length of Barrett's and motility in a 1-to-1 fashion. A total of 523 patients (177 MSA, 346 NF) underwent surgery and after matching 177 MSA and 177 NF were analyzed. At 1 year, GERD quality of life scores improved (22 to 5 MSA vs 24 to 5 NF, p=0.593). PPI use was 14% vs 5% (p=0.010). pH testing demonstrated improved DeMeester scores (42 to 21 vs 46 to 7, p<0.001). At 5 years, GERD quality of life scores were stable (5 to 5 vs 5 to 4, p=0.208). PPI use was 31% vs 26% (p=0.474). The incidence of endoscopic dilation was similar between MSA and NF (7% vs 10%, p=0.347).

"39305994","Cesarean delivery, labor duration and mothers' mortality risk over 50 years of follow-up: Cesarean delivery and maternal mortality.","Pregnancy complications have been recognized as a window to future health. Though cesarean delivery is common, it is unknown whether labor duration and mode of delivery are associated with maternal long-term mortality. To examine whether labor duration and mode of delivery were associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Participants were mothers from the multisite Collaborative Perinatal Project cohort (1959-1966; n=43646, limited to last Collaborative Perinatal Project delivery). We ascertained all-cause and specific causes of death as of 2016 via linkage to the National Death Index and Social Security Death Master File. Hazard ratios testing mode of delivery and labor duration were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. We further stratified analyses by parity. Among participants with a recorded delivery mode, 5.9% (2486/42335) had a cesarean delivery. Participants who had a cesarean were older (26.9 versus 24.3 years), with higher BMI (24.0 versus 22.7 kg/m2), were less likely to be nulliparous (21% versus 30%), and more likely to have a household income of at least $6000 (22% versus 17%), to smoke ≥1 pack/day (18% versus 15%), to have diabetes mellitus (12% versus 1%) and to have a prior medical condition (47% versus 34%), compared to participants with a vaginal delivery. Delivery mode was similar by race/ethnicity, marital status, and education. Median labor duration was 395 minutes among participants who had an intrapartum cesarean delivery and 350 minutes among participants delivered vaginally. By 2016, 52.2% of participants with a cesarean delivery and 38.5% of participants with a vaginal delivery had died. Cesarean versus vaginal delivery was significantly associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.23); in nulliparas, hazard ratio = 1.27 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.47); in multiparas, hazard ratio = 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.21)) as well as increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, infection, and kidney disease. Associations with death from cardiovascular disease, infection and kidney disease were stronger for multiparas than nulliparas, though the association with death from diabetes was stronger among nulliparas. Labor duration was not significantly related to overall mortality. In a historic United States cohort with a low cesarean delivery rate, cesarean delivery was an indicator for subsequent increased mortality risk, particularly related to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Future studies with long-term follow-up are warranted given the current high prevalence of cesarean delivery.","Susanna D Mitro, Rajeshwari Sundaram, Sonia M Grandi, Stefanie N Hinkle, James L Mills, Pauline Mendola, Sunni L Mumford, Yan Qiao, Anokhi Cifuentes, Cuilin Zhang, Enrique F Schisterman, Katherine L Grantz","American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM","2024Sep19",NA
"39305981","Seven glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists for weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight: an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","This study aimed to provide evidence-based support and a reference for the efficacy and safety of seven glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and polyagonists for weight loss in patients with obesity or overweight through a network meta-analysis. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an intervention duration of at least 16 weeks assessing seven GLP-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists (mazdutide, 6 or 4.5 mg; retatrutide, 12 or 8 mg; tirzepatide, 15 or 10 mg; liraglutide, 3.0 mg; semaglutide, 2.4 mg; orforglipron, 45 or 36 mg; and beinaglutide, 0.2 mg) in patient with obesity or overweight was searched using three databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) from creation to August 30, 2024. The primary outcome was the percentage change in body weight from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c, and fasting plasma glucose level from baseline; adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse event withdrawal, and hypoglycemic events. We conducted a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis to analyze the data extracted from the RCTs using Stata 16.1 software. Twenty-seven RCTs of seven GLP-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists and 15,584 patients were included in the network meta-analysis. In terms of efficacy, compared with placebo, retatrutide 12 mg (-22.10 % in body weight and - 17.00 cm in waist circumference), retatrutide 8 mg (-20.70 % and - 15.90 cm), and tirzepatide 15 mg (-16.53 % and - 13.23 cm) were the three most efficacious treatments for reducing body weight and waist circumference. However, these treatments were less effective in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, patients with a high body mass index (BMI) or longer treatment cycles exhibited significantly greater weight loss than those with a low BMI or shorter treatment cycles. In terms of safety, patients without T2DM had a higher incidence of adverse events than those with T2DM. None of the interventions increased the incidence of serious adverse or hypoglycemic events (˂54 mg/dL). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse event withdrawal for all interventions in head-to-head comparisons. In addition, disparities in race, BMI, and treatment cycles did not significantly increase the incidence of adverse events. Finally, the sensitivity and publication bias analyses indicated that the basic analysis results were reliable. Retatrutide (both doses) and tirzepatide exhibited superior efficacy compared to other GLP-1 receptor agonists and polyagonists in reducing body weight and waist circumference. Patients without T2DM, those with a high BMI, and individuals undergoing longer treatment cycles demonstrated significantly greater weight loss and reductions in waist circumference. Dual or triple receptor agonists (GLP-1 plus glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and/or Glucagon receptor) are more effective for weight loss than GLP-1 receptor agonists.","Zeyu Xie, Guimei Zheng, Zhuoru Liang, Mengting Li, Weishang Deng, Weiling Cao","Metabolism: clinical and experimental","2024Sep19",NA

"39305753","Trunk-to-leg volume and appendicular lean mass from a commercial 3-dimensional optical body scanner for disease risk identification.","Body shape expressed as the trunk-to-leg volume ratio is associated with diabetes and mortality due to the associations between higher adiposity and lower lean mass with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) risk. Reduced appendicular muscle mass is associated with malnutrition risk and age-related frailty, and is a risk factor for poor treatment outcomes related to MetS and other clinical conditions (e.g.; cancer). These measures are traditionally assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which can be difficult to access in clinical settings. The Shape Up! Adults trial (SUA) demonstrated the accuracy and precision of 3-dimensional optical imaging (3DO) for body composition as compared to DXA and other criterion measures. Here we assessed whether trunk-to-leg volume estimates derived from 3DO are associated with MetS risk in a similar way as when measured by DXA. We further explored if estimations of appendicular lean mass (ALM) could be made using 3DO to further improve the accessibility of measuring this important frailty and disease risk factor. SUA recruited participants across sex, age (18-40, 40-60, >60 years), BMI (under, normal, overweight, obese), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic [NH] Black, NH White, Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) categories. Each participant had whole-body DXA and 3DO scans, and measures of cardiovascular health. The 3DO measures of trunk and leg volumes were calibrated to DXA to express equivalent trunk-to-leg volume ratios. We expressed each blood measure and overall MetS risk in quartile gradations of trunk-to-leg volume previously defined by National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Finally, we utilized 3DO measures to estimate DXA ALM using ten-fold cross-validation of the entire dataset. Participants were 502 (273 female) adults, mean age = 46.0 ± 16.5y, BMI = 27.6 ± 7.1 kg/m2 and a mean DXA trunk-to-leg volume ratio of 1.47 ± 0.22 (females: 1.43 ± 0.23; males: 1.52 ± 0.20). After adjustments for age and sex, each standard deviation increase in trunk-to-leg volume by 3DO was associated with a 3.3 (95% odds ratio [OR] = 2.4-4.2) times greater risk of MetS, with individuals in the highest quartile of trunk-to-leg at 27.4 (95% CI: 9.0-53.1) times greater risk of MetS compared to the lowest quartile. Risks of elevated blood biomarkers as related to high 3DO trunk-to-leg volume ratios were similar to previously published comparisons using DXA trunk-to-leg volume ratios. Estimated ALM by 3DO was correlated to DXA (r2 = 0.96, root mean square error = 1.5 kg) using ten-fold cross-validation. Using thresholds of trunk-to-leg associated with MetS developed on a sample of US-representative adults, trunk-to-leg ratio by 3DO after adjustments for offsets showed significant associations to blood parameters and MetS risk. 3DO scans provide a precise and accurate estimation of ALM across the range of body sizes included in the study sample. The development of these additional measures improves the clinical utility of 3DO for the assessment of MetS risk as well as the identification of low muscle mass associated with poor cardiometabolic and functional health.","Jonathan P Bennett, Michael C Wong, Yong En Liu, Brandon K Quon, Nisa N Kelly, Andrea K Garber, Steven B Heymsfield, John A Shepherd","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","2024Oct","Humans; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Body Composition; Absorptiometry, Photon; Young Adult; Leg; Metabolic Syndrome; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Adolescent; Risk Factors; Torso; Risk Assessment; Aged; Optical Imaging; Body Mass Index"

The objective of this study was to compare the morphological and mechanical properties of cervical muscles in individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia who also experience migraine headaches with those who do not. The study included two groups of fibromyalgia patients: one with migraine (n = 18, age = 44.7 ± 7.5 years, body mass index = 28.7 ± 6.9 kg/m2) and one without migraine (n = 21, age = 42.6 ± 9.5 years, body mass index = 25.1 ± 4.4 kg/m2). Body pain intensity related to fibromyalgia and migraine attack severity were evaluated with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The cervical muscle morphological and mechanical properties, including thickness, cross-sectional area (CSA), and stiffness, were measured using ultrasound imaging. It was found that there was a greater decrease in longus colli muscle CSA scores (p = 0.004) and a greater increase in upper trapezius muscle stiffness scores (p = 0.013) in the fibromyalgia + migraine group compared to the fibromyalgia group.

In addition, this study compared mortality from NCDs with mortality from all causes and COVID-19, analysed NCD mortality trends and projections for 2030, and analysed NCD mortality rates and risk factors attributed to these deaths among the 27 states of Brazil. Ecological studies. This study used the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) database from 1990 to 2021. Premature deaths from four NCDs (neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes mellitus) were analysed. The following metrics were used to analyse the burden of NCDs in Brazil: absolute number of deaths, proportional mortality, mortality rate, years of life lost due to premature death (YLL), years lived with disabilities (YLD) and disability-adjusted years of life lost due to premature death (DALY). For comparison between the years studied and states, age-standardised rates were used. Finding from this study showed that there was increase in the proportion of premature deaths due to NCDs between 1990 and 2019 (29.4 % in 1990, 30.8 % in 2019), and a reduction in 2021 (24.7 %). The mortality rates, DALY and YLL from NCDs declined between 1990 and 2019 (-37.7 %, -34.5 % and -38.3 %, respectively); however, a stability in mortality rates, DALY, YLD, YLL was observed between 2019 and 2021 (-0.1 %, 0.7 %, -0.1 % and 0.8 %, respectively). Between 1990 and 2021, there was a decline in mortality rates, DALY and YLL for most states and an increase in YLD rates. However, results suggest that the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for the reduction in mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030 will not be achieved. The main risk factors associated with premature death from NCDs in 2021 were high blood pressure, tobacco use, dietary risks, high body mass index (BMI) and high blood glucose levels. The correlation between sociodemographic index and percentage change in mortality rates was significant for the following total NCDs, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and neoplasms. The current study highlights the importance of deaths from NCDs in Brazil and the worsening of mortality rates since 2016, as a result of austerity measures and the COVID-19 pandemic, which compromises the achievement of the SDG reduced mortality targets for NCDs. There was a reduction in risk factors for NCDs, mainly behavioural, although metabolic risk factors are of great concern and require new strategies to promote health, prevention and comprehensive care.","Deborah Carvalho Malta, Crizian Saar Gomes, Guilherme Augusto Veloso, Renato Azeredo Teixeira, Mariana Santos Felisbino Mendes, Luisa Campos Caldeira Brant, Elton Junio Sady Prates, Alanna Gomes Silva, Juliana Bottoni de Souza, Bruce Bartholow Duncan, Maria Inês Schmidt, Maria de Fátima Marinho de Souza, Ana Maria Nogales Vasconcelos, Célia Landmann Szwarcwald, Jorge Gustavo Velásquez Meléndez, Ísis Eloah Machado, Mohsen Naghavi, Antônio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro","Public health","2024Sep20",NA
"39298222","Exploring the underlying psychological constructs of self-report eating behavior measurements: Toward a comprehensive framework.","Food and eating are fundamental for survival but also have significant impacts on health, psychology, sociology, and economics. Understanding what motivates people to eat can provide insights into ""adaptive"" eating behavior, which is especially important due to the increasing prevalence of health-related conditions such as obesity. There has been considerable interest in developing theoretical models and associated constructs that explain individual differences in eating behavior. However, many of these models contain overlapping theories and shared theoretical mechanisms of action. Currently, there is no recognized standard framework that integrates psychological, physiological, and neurobiological theory to help explain human eating behavior. The aim of the current article was to review key psychological theories in relation to energy balance, homeostasis, energy intake, and motivation to eat and begin to develop a comprehensive framework of relevant factors that drive eating behavior. The key findings from this review suggest that eating behavior is conceptualized by elements of dual process models, which include conscious processing (reflective factors) and automatic responses to desires, environmental cues, habits, and associative learning. These processes are mediated by neurobiology and physiological signaling (homeostatic feedback) of energy balance, which is more tolerant of positive than negative energy balances. From a synthesis of available evidence, it is suggested that eating behavior constructs (traits) can be explained by three latent constructs: reflective, reactive, and homeostatic eating. By understanding the interplay between reflective, reactive, and homeostatic processes, interventions can be developed that tailor treatments to target key aspects of eating behavior.

To investigate the associations of preconception BMI in both partners with time to pregnancy and miscarriage. This population-based prospective cohort study was conducted in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between August 9, 2017, and July 1, 2021. A total of 3604 women and their partners were included from the preconception period onward with follow-up until birth. The date of analysis was July 12, 2024. Body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) measured in preconception or early pregnancy. Fecundability, defined as the probability of conceiving within 1 month; subfertility, defined as time to pregnancy or duration of actively pursuing pregnancy of more than 12 months or use of assisted reproductive technology; and miscarriage, defined as pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestation. These measures were assessed using questionnaires and via the obstetric caregiver. The study population for time-to-pregnancy analyses consisted of 3033 episodes among women (median age, 31.6 years [IQR, 29.2-34.5 years]; median BMI, 23.5 [IQR, 21.2-26.5]) and 2288 episodes among men (median age, 33.4 years [IQR, 30.5-36.8 years]; median BMI, 24.9 [IQR, 23.0-27.4]). The study population for miscarriage analyses consisted of 2770 pregnancy episodes among women (median age, 31.5 years [IQR, 28.9-34.3 years]; median BMI, 23.5 [IQR, 21.3-26.7]) and 2189 pregnancy episodes among men (median age, 33.5 years [IQR, 30.4-36.8 years]; median BMI, 25.0 [IQR, 23.0-27.5]). Higher BMI in women and men was associated with lower fecundability: for every unit increase in BMI, fecundability decreased (fecundability ratio [FR]: women, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-0.99]; men, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98-1.00]). Women with overweight (FR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80-0.98]) and obesity (FR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.63-0.82]) had lower fecundability compared with women with normal weight. Compared with normal weight in women, underweight (odds ratio [OR], 1.88 [95% CI, 1.22-2.88]), overweight (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.11-1.63]), and obesity (OR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.30-2.13]) were associated with increased odds of subfertility. In men, obesity was associated with increased odds of subfertility (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.24-2.31]). Compared with normal weight in women, overweight (OR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.12-1.98]) and obesity (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.00-2.08]) were associated with increased odds of miscarriage. In this cohort study, BMI outside of the normal category in women and men during the preconception or early-pregnancy periods was associated with time to pregnancy and miscarriage. Optimizing BMI in women and men from the preconception period onward might be an important strategy to improve fertility outcomes.","Aline J Boxem, Sophia M Blaauwendraad, Annemarie G M G J Mulders, Eline L Bekkers, Claudia J Kruithof, Eric A P Steegers, Romy Gaillard, Vincent W V Jaddoe","JAMA network open","2024Sep03","Humans; Body Mass Index; Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Male; Abortion, Spontaneous; Time-to-Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Netherlands; Obesity; Risk Factors; Fertility"
"39297827","Pain Interference Prior to and 1 Year After Surgery for Adult Traumatic Brachial Plexus Injury.","Pain after brachial plexus injury (BPI) can be severely debilitating and is poorly understood. We hypothesized that pain interference (PI) (""the extent to which pain hinders engagement in life"") would be predicted by depression, anxiety, severity of pain symptoms, and poorer preoperative muscle function. Among patients in a prospective multicenter BPI cohort study, 37 completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) PI questionnaires before and 1 year after surgery. At both times, participants completed anxiety and depression questionnaires and BPI-specific measures of pain symptoms, physical limitations, and emotional recovery. Surgeon-graded muscle testing, injury severity, age at the time of injury, body mass index, and time from injury to surgery were included. We performed a bivariate analysis of predictors for preoperative and 1-year PROMIS PI followed by multivariable regression modeling using stepwise selection and Bayesian Information Criterion to select covariates. Before surgery, the mean PROMIS PI score was 60.8 ± 11.0, with moderate correlations between PROMIS PI and depression, as well as between PROMIS PI and functional limitations. At 1 year after surgery, the mean PROMIS PI score was 59.7 ± 9.5. There was no difference in preoperative and 1-year PROMIS PI. There were strong correlations between PROMIS PI and pain symptoms, functional limitations, and emotional aspects of recovery at the 1-year follow-up that remained significant in multivariable regression. There were no notable associations between muscle testing and PI. Pain interference remained substantial and elevated in BPI patients 1 year after surgery. We noted strong associations between PI and pain symptoms, functional limitations, and emotional aspects of recovery. These findings demonstrate the persistence of pain as a feature throughout life after BPI and that its treatment should be considered a priority alongside efforts to improve extremity function.

"39297743","Weight Bias in the Perinatal Period: An Integrative Review.","Weight bias toward individuals with higher body weights in healthcare settings is associated with adverse health behaviors, reduced healthcare utilization, and poor health outcomes. The purpose of this integrative review was to explore: (1) What has been measured and described regarding perinatal care providers' and students' weight bias toward pregnant, birthing, and postpartum individuals with higher body weights? (2) What has been measured and described regarding pregnant, birthing, and postpartum individuals' experiences of weight bias? (3) What is the association of experiences of weight bias with perinatal and mental health outcomes among pregnant, birthing, and postpartum individuals? We conducted a systematic search in CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases to identify relevant research publications related to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms weight prejudice (and related terms) and pregnancy (and related terms). The review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice model for study quality determination, and the Whittemore and Knafl integrative review framework for data extraction and analyses. Twenty-two publications met inclusion criteria, representing six countries and varying study designs. This review found pervasive sources of explicit weight bias in the perinatal period, including care providers and close relationships. Experiences of weight bias among pregnant and postpartum individuals are associated with adverse perinatal and mental health outcomes. The findings address a knowledge gap regarding a summary of literature on weight bias in the perinatal period and elucidate its prevalence as well as its negative influence on perinatal and mental health outcomes. Future research efforts on this topic must examine the nature and extent of perinatal care providers' weight bias by demographic factors and explore its association with clinical decision-making and perinatal and mental health outcomes.","Heather M Bradford, Rebecca M Puhl, Julia C Phillippi, Mary S Dietrich, Jeremy L Neal","Birth (Berkeley, Calif.)","2024Sep19",NA
"39297573","The Battle of Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies for Obesity: Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty Versus Endoscopically Inserted Intragastric Balloon-A Pairwise Meta-Analysis of Comparative Studies and a Call for Randomized Controlled Trials.","Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) represents the latest primary endoscopic intervention for managing obesity. Both ESG and intragastric balloons (IGBs) have demonstrated effectiveness and safety for weight loss. However, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence supporting the superiority of one over the other, and no pairwise meta-analysis of comparative studies has been published to date. Our aim was to conduct a pairwise meta-analysis of comparative studies directly comparing ESG and IGB. We systematically conducted a literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our search used specific search terms. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) Tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4.1 software with a random-effects model. The statistical method used was the Mantel-Haenszel method. For dichotomous data, the effect size was represented using odds ratio (OR), while mean difference (MD) was utilized as the effect size for continuous data. After screening 967 records, a total of 9 studies met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis (5302 patients). The quality assessment categorized 5 studies as having a moderate risk of bias, while 3 studies were classified as having a low risk of bias. Sufficient information was not available for one study to ascertain its overall quality. A statistically significant increase in total weight loss percentage (TWL%) at 1 and 6 months was observed with ESG compared with IGB. In addition, a statistically insignificant decrease in the incidence of adverse events and readmissions was observed with ESG. Furthermore, a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of reintervention was observed with ESG. While this study suggests a higher TWL% associated with ESG compared with IGB, drawing definitive conclusions is challenging due to limitations identified during a comprehensive quality assessment of the available literature. We advocate for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly comparing the newer IGB (with a 12-mo placement duration) with ESG. However, this study consistently reveals higher rates of early reintervention (re-endoscopy) within the IGB group, primarily necessitated by the removal or adjustment of the IGB due to intolerance. Given the additional intervention required at 6 or 12 months to remove the temporarily placed IGB, this trend may imply that IGB is less economically viable than ESG. Cost-effectiveness analyses comparing ESG and IGB are warranted to provide valuable scientific insights.","Abdul-Rahman F Diab, Joseph A Sujka, Kathleen Mattingly, Mehak Sachdeva, Kenneth Hackbarth, Salvatore Docimo, Christopher G DuCoin","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","2024Sep19",NA
"39297405","Multiple positive points during the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test are good predictors for early insulin therapy in gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed before 24 gestational weeks.","This study evaluated the risk factors for insulin therapy before 24 gestational weeks (early insulin therapy) in pregnant women with gestational diabetes diagnosed before 24 gestational weeks (E-GDM). This study included 530 singleton mothers with E-GDM who underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the first trimester at Keio University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2021. E-GDM can be classified according to its management into only diet therapy until delivery (Diet E-GDM), insulin therapy started before 24 gestational weeks (EarlyIns E-GDM), and insulin therapy started after 24 gestational weeks (LateIns E-GDM). We analyzed the risk factors for EarlyIns E-GDM. Patients with EarlyIns E-GDM had a significantly higher maternal age at delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, first trimester hemoglobin A1c, 1 h plasma glucose levels (1 h-PG), and 2 h-PG, as well as a more pronounced initial increase and subsequent decrease, compared with those in the Diet E-GDM group. However, the Apgar scores at both 1 and 5 min were significantly lower in patients with EarlyIns E-GDM than in those with Diet E-GDM. The number of abnormal values in the OGTT showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting EarlyIns E-GDM (0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.86), followed by the 1 h-PG value (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77-0.85). The initial increase showed the third largest AUC (0.78, 95% CI: 0.74-0.82). Although further research is needed, our data suggest the importance of early insulin therapy in cases of E-GDM with multiple abnormal OGTT values, especially with high 1 h-PG levels and initial increase.","Yoshifumi Kasuga, Marina Takahashi, Kaoru Kajikawa, Keisuke Akita, Junko Tamai, Yuka Fukuma, Yuya Tanaka, Keita Hasegawa, Toshimitsu Otani, Satoru Ikenoue, Mamoru Tanaka","Journal of diabetes investigation","2024Sep19",NA
"39297398","Practice Recommendations for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease by the Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ISPGHAN).","There has been an alarming increase in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and it is now the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, in both adult and pediatric populations. The lack of regional guidelines has hampered the formulation of national policies for prevention and management of MASLD in children. Therefore, we formulated recommendations for steatotic liver disease in children. To review the existing literature on the burden and epidemiology of pediatric MASLD and formulate recommendations for diagnostic evaluation, prevention, and management strategies. The Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition invited national and international stakeholders to participate in a consensus meeting held on April 20, 2024, in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Various aspects of pediatric steatotic liver disease were deliberated upon and a consensus document and recommendations were formulated after several rounds of discussion. Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) should be used as the preferred term in place of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is a high prevalence of steatotic liver disease (SLD) among Indian children and adolescents, especially those who are overweight or obese. This condition may be progressive in childhood and associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Various lifestyle, dietary, and genetic factors may predispose individuals to MASLD, including an increased intake of calorie-dense processed foods, sweetened sugar beverages, excessive screen time, higher sedentary time and lack of moderate to vigorous physical activity. MASLD is usually asymptomatic or presents with mild, non-specific symptoms and therefore, a high degree of suspicion is required for early diagnosis. MASLD is usually associated with cardiometabolic factors (hypertension, insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus, and/or dyslipidemia) and secondary causes should be excluded in all cases, particularly in the presence of red flag signs. Screening for MASLD should be considered in all obese children (body mass index or BMI ≥ 95th percentile) and in all overweight children (BMI ≥ 85th and <95thpercentile) with additional risk factors, such as prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia, positive family history of metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypopituitarism. Abdominal ultrasound in combination with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels should be used as a screening test for MASLD in Indian children as per the proposed algorithm. Diet (any hypocaloric diet) and exercise (aerobic, resistance, or a combination of both; moderate to high intensity; regular in frequency) remain the cornerstones of pediatric MASLD management. Pharmacotherapy and/or endoscopic/surgical techniques for obesity should be considered as adjuncts and should be considered only after a failed adequate trial of lifestyle modifications.","Vikrant Sood, Seema Alam, Aabha Nagral, Anshu Srivastava, Aniket Deshmukh, Ashish Bavdekar, Bhaswati C Acharyya, S M Geetha, Girish Gupte, Ishitaa Bhatia, Kritika Tiwari, Lalit Bharadia, Malathi Sathiyasekaran, Prabhsaran Kaur, Rajeev Khanna, Rimjhim Shrivastava, Samriddhi Poyekar, Snehavardhan Pandey, Somashekara Hosaagrahara Ramakrishna, Upendra Kinjawadekar, Vibhor Borkar, Viswanathan M Sivaramakrishnan, Rohit Kohli, John Matthai, Anil Dhawan","Indian pediatrics","2024Sep13",NA

We found that CFO significantly and immediately reduced pain (p < .01) improved CoP values (p < .01) in the unipedal stance with the affected foot, and enhanced TUG test scores (p < .001). The results demonstrated a significant (p < .01) improvement in CoParea values and TUG test scores with CFO, compared to SI. These findings underscore the immediate benefits of CFO in alleviating pain and improving postural balance in obese middle-aged women with PF, highlighting their potential as a valuable intervention.","Ameni Hammami, Ghada Jouira, Sonia Sahli","Perceptual and motor skills","2024Sep21",NA
"39305499","Infectious Complications After Modified Purse-String Stoma Closure.","Purpose: Current society guidelines recommend purse-string closure technique for stoma reversal, which has been shown to reduce but not eliminate the risk of deep surgical site infection (SSI) at the original stoma site, a complication associated with increased morbidity and cost. We studied an adjunctive technique to further reduce the risk of SSI. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on adult patients who underwent stoma reversal between May 2016 - July 2022. Stoma reversal was performed with purse-string closure, and placement of a strip of povidone-iodine soaked non-adherent pad in the remaining two cm opening at the prior stoma site. This pad was taken out on post-operative day one and changed to wet-to-dry saline moistened gauze. Results: 82 patients were identified. The cohort had a median BMI 26.5 [IQR 23.0-31.0] and median age 57.5 [IQR 45.8-67.0]. Mean time from original surgery to reversal was nine months. 59.8% identified as female, 24.4% were currently smoking, 18.3% were had diabetes. The cohort experienced a 11.0% readmission rate and 18.3% rate of stoma site hernia with a mean follow up of 17 17 months. No patient developed an SSI. Conclusion: In this cohort study with known risk factors for SSI, no patients undergoing stoma reversal experienced a post-operative SSI. The adjunctive technique of a povidone-iodine soaked non-adherent pad in addition to purse-string closure should be further examined in conjunction with surgical bundles to reduce the risk of SSI and overall morbidity of stoma reversal surgery.","Scarlett B Hao, Lindsey Bridges, Michael D Honaker","The American surgeon","2024Sep21",NA

We conducted a retrospective case-control study analyzing data from 88 women with PCOS and 82 healthy controls. Participants were categorized by BMI (<24.0 kg/m2and ≥24.0 kg/m2) and PCOS subtypes. We compared periodontal parameters [including probing depth (PD), gingival bleeding index (GBI)] and reproductive hormone-related parameters. Women with PCOS and periodontitis had a significantly higher GBI (2.71 ± 0.53) compared to controls (2.25 ± 0.41, p < 0.0001). Among patients with BMI <24.0 kg/m2, those with PCOS had a younger age [25.00(5.00) vs. 26.00(6.00) years, p < 0.05], lower PD [3.24(0.55) mm vs. 3.43 (0.48) mm, p < 0.01], and higher GBI [2.63(0.76) vs. 2.23(0.55), p < 0.0001]. For BMI ≥24.0 kg/m2, PCOS patients had a higher GBI [2.91(0.36) vs. 2.38(0.59), p < 0.01] but a lower percentage of severe periodontal disease (p < 0.05). PCOS could potentially worsen gingival inflammation among women already suffering from periodontitis, and a higher BMI might further intensify this correlation.","Xiaodan Liu, Fengran Wang, Xiao Wang, Qingxian Luan","Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology","2024Dec","Humans; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Female; Body Mass Index; Adult; Periodontitis; Retrospective Studies; Case-Control Studies; Young Adult; China; Periodontal Index; East Asian People"

This study aimed to describe the characteristics and in-hospital outcomes, both overall and stratified by gender and resection, and to explore factors associated with outcomes of first hospitalization, in older GC patients. Data on GC patients ≥ 65 years hospitalized from January 2016 until December 2020 were retrieved from the electronic medical records of a large tertiary hospital. Patient and tumor characteristics, duration and fee of hospitalization, and in-hospital mortality were described for overall patients and compared by gender and resection. Factors associated with outcomes of first hospitalization were explored using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression. 3238 eligible patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 71 years and a male proportion of 74%. The median duration and fee of first hospitalization were 13 days and 40,000 RMB, respectively, with a median fee of 17,000 RMB not covered by insurance. 16 (< 1%) and 32 (1%) deaths occurred during first and any hospitalization, respectively, with only 4 (< 1%) perioperative deaths. Compared to male patients, female cases had more often signet-ring-cell carcinoma, reduced food intake, resection, and history of major abdominal surgery. Compared to unresected cases, resected patients had higher body-mass-index and Barthel index, less often reduced food intake, weight loss, and risk of malnutrition, and more often common diet, longer hospital stay, and higher fee. Through multivariable-adjusted analysis, longer first hospital-stay was associated with earlier year of diagnosis, older ages, emergency admission, signet-ring-cell carcinoma, resection, history of anticoagulant intake, larger body-mass-index, non-common diet, and non-low-salt and non-diabetes diets; higher fee of first hospitalization was associated with later year of diagnosis, male gender, older ages, emergency admission, signet-ring-cell carcinoma, and resection. In this large institution-based study, older GC patients had low in-hospital mortality rates; the insurance coverage needs to be improved. Several characteristics and in-hospital outcomes significantly differed by gender and resection status, and various factors associated with duration and fee of first hospitalization were identified, providing important hints for individualized and stratified geriatric GC care.","Lei Huang, Yunmei Liu, Lei Wang, Lan Rong, Weiguo Hu","European geriatric medicine","2024Sep21",NA
"39305371","Increased expression of IL-1β in adipose tissue in obesity influences the development of colon cancer by promoting inflammation.","Excess adiposity contributes to the development of colon carcinoma (CC). Interleukin (IL)-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine relevant in obesity-associated chronic inflammation and tumorigenic processes. We herein aimed to study how obesity and CC affects the expression of IL1B, and to determine the impact of IL-1β on the regulation of metabolic inflammation and gut barrier function in the context of obesity and CC. Samples from 71 volunteers were used in a case-control study and a rat model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Furthermore, bariatric surgery was used to determine the effect of weight loss on the intestinal gene expression levels of Il1b. To evaluate the effect of IL-1β and obesity in CC, we treated the adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 with IL-1β and the adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from patients with obesity. We showed that obesity (P < 0.05) and CC (P < 0.01) upregulated the transcript levels of IL1B in visceral adipose tissue as well as in the colon from patients with CC (P < 0.01). The increased expression of Il1b in the ileum and colon in DIO rats decreased after weight loss achieved by either sleeve gastrectomy or caloric restriction (both P < 0.05). ACM treatment on HT-29 cells upregulated (P < 0.05) the transcripts of IL1B and CCL2, while reducing (P < 0.05) the expression of the anti-inflammatory ADIPOQ and MUC2 genes. Additionally, IL-1β upregulated (P < 0.01) the expression of CCL2 and TNF whilst downregulating (P < 0.01) the transcript levels of IL4, ADIPOQ and TJP1 in HT-29 cells. We provide evidence of the important role of IL-1β in obesity-associated CC by directly promoting inflammation.","Gabriela Neira, Javier Gómez-Ambrosi, Javier A Cienfuegos, Beatriz Ramírez, Sara Becerril, Amaia Rodríguez, María A Burrell, Jorge Baixauli, Amaia Mentxaka, Marcos Casado, Camilo Silva, Javier Escalada, Gema Frühbeck, Victoria Catalán","Journal of physiology and biochemistry","2024Sep21",NA
"39305336","Small extracellular vesicles derived from adipose mesenchymal stem cells alleviate intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting the FAK/Akt signaling pathway via MFGE8.","Intestinal fibrosis is one of the most frequent and severe complications of Crohn's disease. Accumulating studies have reported that adipose mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (AMSC-sEVs) could alleviate renal fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, etc., while their potential for treating intestinal fibrosis remains uncertain. Therefore, this study aims to determine the therapeutic effects of AMSC-sEVs on intestinal fibrosis and identify the mechanisms underlying these effects. AMSC-sEVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. Whether AMSC-sEVs exert antifibrotic effects was investigated in two different murine models of intestinal fibrosis. Besides, AMSC-sEVs were co-cultured with primary human fibroblasts and CCD18co during transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 stimulation. Label-free proteomics and rescue experiments were performed to identify candidate molecules in AMSC-sEVs. Transcriptome sequencing revealed changes in mRNA levels among different groups. Lastly, proteins related to relevant signaling pathways were identified by western blotting, and their expression and activation status were assessed. AMSC-sEVs positively expressed CD63 and Alix and presented a classical ""rim of a cup"" and granule shape with approximately 43-100 nm diameter. AMSCs significantly alleviated intestinal fibrosis through secreted sEVs in vitro and in vivo. The milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8) was stably enriched in AMSC-sEVs and was an active compound contributing to the treatment of intestinal fibrosis by AMSCs. Mechanistically, AMSC-sEV-based therapies attenuated intestinal fibrosis by inhibiting the FAK/Akt signaling pathway. MFGE8-containing AMSC-sEVs attenuate intestinal fibrosis, partly through FAK/Akt pathway inhibition.","Zhizhong Xiong, Xianzhe Li, Minghao Xie, Jianping Guo, Shi Yin, Dayin Huang, Longyang Jin, Caiqin Wang, Fengxiang Zhang, Chaobin Mao, Huaxian Chen, Dandong Luo, Haijie Tang, Xijie Chen, Lei Lian","Journal of gastroenterology","2024Sep21",NA

This study aimed to identify high-priority segments for salt reduction interventions using the TARPARE model in a rural Japanese city. This cross-sectional study used convenient sampling. Scored indicators of the TARPARE model were used, and data was collected from 1874 adults to establish the priority order of target segments for promoting salt reduction. The model considers the total number of individuals (T), at-risk persons (AR), persuasibility (P), accessibility (A), resources required (R), and equity (E). For T, the salt content was evaluated using spot urine, and the salt check sheet was scored for each segment according to sex and age in the city's population. AR was the individuals who were overweight. P was determined by the behavior modification stage of salt reduction, unknown recommended salt reduction goals, and lack of knowledge in at least one aspect of salt reduction. A and R were characterized by communication with family or friends and family support, respectively. E was considered an education up to high school. The average aggregated score was 19.9 (standard deviation = 14.0), with higher scores in segments that consistently subjectively restrict salt intake but have a high objective salt intake. The highest priority was given to women in their 60s (49.3 points) and 70s (54.4 points). This study identified high-priority populations for salt reduction in a rural city in Japan.

The investigation focused on the interplay between COVID-19 diagnosis timing, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes, particularly considering the potential mechanisms by which COVID-19 may contribute to increased complications. This case control study included patients who underwent ankle fracture surgery using the N3C database. The cohort was divided into two groups: patients without COVID-19 diagnosis within 12 weeks of surgery (n = 16 806) and those with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis within 12 weeks of surgery (n = 369). Demographic factors were analyzed. Clinical outcomes encompassed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), sepsis, surgical site infection, bleeding, acute kidney injury, 30-day mortality, and 365-day mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. The COVID-19-positive cohort displayed a slightly higher mean age (52.95 ± 18.43 vs 51.62 ± 18.36, P = .169) and body mass index (34.88 ± 9.99 vs 33.86 ± 8.80, P = .028) compared to the negative cohort. Although some outcomes, such as DVT and sepsis, demonstrated slightly higher frequencies in the COVID-19-positive group, these differences were not statistically significant.

"39304913","An antimicrobial microneedle patch promotes functional healing of infected wounds through controlled release of adipose tissue-derived apoptotic vesicles.","The high incidence and mortality rates associated with acute and chronic wound infections impose a significant burden on global healthcare systems. In terms of the management of wound infection, the reconstruction and regeneration of skin appendages are essential for the recovery of mechanical strength and physiological function in the regenerated skin tissue. Novel therapeutic approaches are a requisite for enhancing the healing of infected wounds and promoting the regeneration of skin appendages. Herein, a novel antimicrobial microneedle patch has been fabricated for the transdermal controlled delivery of adipose tissue-derived apoptotic vesicles (ApoEVs-AT@MNP) for the treatment of infected wounds, which is expected to achieve high-quality scarless healing of the wound skin while inhibiting the bacteria in the infected wound. The microneedle patch (MNP) system possesses adequate mechanical strength to penetrate the skin, allowing the tips to remain inside tissue for continuous active release of biomolecules, and subsequently degrades safely within the host body. In vivo transplantation demonstrates that ApoEVs-AT@MNP not only inhibits bacterial proliferation in infected wounds but also significantly promotes effective and rapid scarless wound healing. Particularly noteworthy is the ability of ApoEVs-AT@MNP to promote the rapid formation of mature, evenly arranged hair follicles in infected wounds, observed as early as 8 days following implantation, which is essential for the restoration of skin function.

"39304881","Association between triglyceride glucose body mass index and urinary incontinence: a cross-sectional study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2018.","Urinary incontinence (UI) is a prevalent, health-threatening condition that causes isolation and psychological strain, leading to significant personal distress. The connection between the triglyceride glucose body mass index (TyG-BMI) and UI remains elusive. The purpose of the current research was to investigate any possible relationships between raised TyG-BMI levels and a higher likelihood of UI. For a thorough examination, adults 20 years and older with UI were included in cross-sectional research using the data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2018. Our investigation centred on three of the significant varieties of UI: Urgent Urinary Incontinence (UUI), Mixed Urinary Incontinence (MUI), and Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI), employing weighted multivariate logistic regression models for an in-depth evaluation. The TyG-BMI, a possible biomarker, was arranged in increasing order among participants and then assessed with a trend test (P for trend). Moreover, this investigation delved into the non-linear relationships using advanced smoothed curve fitting techniques. Meticulous subgroup analyses were executed to verify the uniformity of the UI and TyG-BMI relationship across diverse demographic groups. A thorough investigation was conducted with 18,751 subjects to analyze the prevalence and types of UI, showing that 23.59% of individuals suffered from SUI, 19.42% from UUI, and 9.32% from MUI. Considering all possible confounding variables, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a substantial relationship between elevated TyG-BMI values and a greater likelihood across all UI categories. Specifically, stratifying the TyG-BMI into quartiles revealed a pronounced positive correlation in the top quartile relative to the bottom, reflected in increased odds ratios for SUI, UUI, and MUI (SUI: OR = 2.36, 95% CI 2.03-2.78, P < 0.0001; UUI: OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.65-2.09, P < 0.0001; MUI: OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.71-2.51, P < 0.0001). Among US adults, an association has been observed wherein increased TyG-BMI values correlate with a higher chance of UI. This suggests that TyG-BMI might be a helpful marker for identifying individuals at risk of UI, providing novel insights into its assessment and management.","JiHang Li, Ruijie Xie, Hu Tian, Dong Wang, MingShen Mo, JianKun Yang, WenBin Guo","Lipids in health and disease","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Body Mass Index; Triglycerides; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Adult; Urinary Incontinence; Blood Glucose; Aged; Logistic Models; Prevalence"
"39304862","The association between the number of food kinds and risk of depression in U.S. adults.","The association between the number of food kinds and the risk of depression in adults was examined. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 4593 adults were included in the study. The number of food kinds was collected via 24‒hour dietary recalls. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire‒9. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were applied to assess the association between the number of food kinds and the risk of depression. This study included 4593 study participants, 451 of whom were diagnosed with depression. The revised advantage ratios (with corresponding confidence intervals) for the prevalence of depression among individuals in the fourth quartiles of the number of food kinds (Q4) in comparison to the lowest quartile (Q1) were determined to be 0.59 (0.36‒0.96), respectively. According to our subgroup analyses, the number of food kinds was negatively associated with the risk of depression in females, participants aged 18‒45 and 45‒65 years, and participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 24.9 kg/m2. According to our dose‒response analysis, the number of food kinds was linearly associated with the risk of depression (Pfor nonlinear=0.5896). The risk of depression exhibited a linear and negative correlation with the number of food kinds. The results indicated that a diversified diet was an effective nonpharmacological approach that deserved further generalization.","Qiu-Hui Xu, Ting Yang, Ke-Yu Jiang, Jin-Dong Liu, Hong-Hui Guo, En-Qin Xia","BMC public health","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Depression; Aged; Young Adult; United States; Adolescent; Risk Factors; Food; Diet; Prevalence; Cross-Sectional Studies"

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of new-onset DM among patients with COVID-19 and examined the short clinical outcomes of the disease. This is a retrospective study of revising electronic medical records to assess the prevalence of new-onset DM in COVID-19 patients and its impact on the severity of the disease. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 during the period from June 2020 to December 2021 were enrolled. 725 patients were included. 53.8% of them were males and 46.2 were females, the mean age was 43.35 ± 16.76. 13.2% were diabetics; 2.2% with preexisting DM and 11.0% had new-onset DM. 6.34% had coexisting medical conditions. DKA at presentation was observed in 6 patients (0.8%) of newly diagnosed DM. There is a significant correlation between age and family history (FH), and BMI and new-onset DM (P < 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 2.2%, and it was significantly higher in diabetics in comparison to non-diabetics (P < 0.001). 8.6% had persistent hyperglycemia after 4 months of follow-up. The prevalence of COVID-19 related new-onset DM was correlated significantly with disease severity and mortality rate. Age, FH, and BMI, were the major predictors. We recommend that frequent monitoring of blood glucose for patients with COVID-19 infections to detect DM, therefore, prompt treatment can be initiated.","Amal H Mohamed, Majid Darraj, Abuobaida Yassin, Mohammed Somaili, Ahmed Sayed, Omar Oraibi, Mostafa Mohrag, Mohammed Ali Madkhali, Sameer Alqassimi, Mohammed A Madkhali","BMC endocrine disorders","2024Sep20","Humans; COVID-19; Male; Saudi Arabia; Female; Adult; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Aged"

An observational, prospective, proof-of-concept study.","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, often necessitating surgical intervention. While surgeries like lumpectomy can be performed under local anesthesia, more extensive procedures typically require general anesthesia. Awake breast cancer surgery has emerged as an alternative due to risks associated with general anesthesia and patient preference. This prospective observational study, conducted from July 2022 to July 2023, evaluated the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided fascial plane blocks for awake breast surgery. Patients aged 18-80 years undergoing unilateral breast surgery were included, following ethical committee approval and written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were prior breast surgery, coagulopathies, infections, allergies to local anesthetics, psychiatric disorders, body mass index over 40 kg/m², and chest deformities. The combination of interpectoral, pecto-serratus, and deep serratus plane blocks was used as the primary anesthetic method, with a superficial parasternal block added in cases where complete cutaneous coverage was not achieved. Seventeen patients were enrolled. The primary outcome, sufficient surgical anesthesia without deep sedation, was achieved in 15 patients. The combination of the aforementioned blocks proved effective, with an average surgery duration of 59.66 min, and propofol requirements averaging 1.77 mg/kg/hour. Most patients reported high satisfaction levels, and no early or late block-related complications were observed. The combination of fascial plane blocks is a viable option for awake breast cancer surgery, potentially eliminating the need for more invasive anesthesia techniques. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings in larger, homogeneous patient groups.","Gamze Ertas, Hamiyet Senol Cakmak, Sonmez Ocak, Mert Yılmaz, Dursun Burak Ozdemir, Serkan Tulgar","BMC anesthesiology","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Aged; Nerve Block; Adult; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Proof of Concept Study; Wakefulness; Aged, 80 and over; Young Adult; Anesthetics, Local; Patient Satisfaction"
"39304796","The extent and burden of high multimorbidity on older adults in the US: a descriptive analysis of Medicare beneficiaries.","The impact of multimorbidity (≥ 2 chronic diseases) on the well-being of older adults is substantial but variable. The burden of multimorbidity varies by the number and kinds of conditions, and timing of onset. The impact varies by age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health indicators. Large scale longitudinal surveys linked to medical claims provide unique opportunities to characterize this variability. We analyzed Medicare-linked Health and Retirement Study data for respondents 65 and older with 3 or more years of fee-for-service coverage (n = 17,199; 2000-2016). We applied standardized claims algorithms for operationalizing 21 chronic diseases. We compared multimorbidity levels, demographics, and outcomes at baseline and over time and escalation to high multimorbidity levels (≥ 5 conditions). At baseline, 51.2% had no multimorbidity, 36.5% had multimorbidity, and 12.4% had high multimorbidity. Loss of function, cognitive decline, and higher healthcare utilization were up to ten times more prevalent in the high multimorbidity group. Greater rates of high multimorbidity were seen among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic groups, those with lower wealth, younger birth cohorts, and adults with obesity. Rates of transition to high multimorbidity varied greatly and was highest among Hispanic and respondents with lower education. The development and progression of multimorbidity in old age is influenced by many factors. Higher levels of multimorbidity are associated with sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting possible mitigation strategies.","David A Dorr, Sheila Markwardt, Michelle Bobo, Heather G Allore, Anda Botoseneanu, Jason T Newsom, Corey Nagel, Ana R Quiñones","BMC geriatrics","2024Sep20","Humans; Multimorbidity; Aged; Male; United States; Female; Medicare; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness"

Here we investigated the peripheral lipidome in 958 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity and 373 with normal weight, in a cross-sectional study. We also implemented a family-based, personalized program to assess the effects of obesity management on 186 children and adolescents in a clinical setting. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we report an increase in ceramides, alongside a decrease in lysophospholipids and omega-3 fatty acids with obesity metabolism. Ceramides, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols were associated with insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risk, whereas sphingomyelins showed inverse associations. Additionally, a panel of three lipids predicted hepatic steatosis as effectively as liver enzymes. Lipids partially mediated the association between obesity and cardiometabolic traits. The nonpharmacological management reduced levels of ceramides, phospholipids and triglycerides, indicating that lowering the degree of obesity could partially restore a healthy lipid profile in children and adolescents.","Yun Huang, Karolina Sulek, Sara E Stinson, Louise Aas Holm, Min Kim, Kajetan Trost, Kourosh Hooshmand, Morten Asp Vonsild Lund, Cilius E Fonvig, Helene Bæk Juel, Trine Nielsen, Lars Ängquist, Peter Rossing, Maja Thiele, Aleksander Krag, Jens-Christian Holm, Cristina Legido-Quigley, Torben Hansen","Nature medicine","2024Sep20",NA

Recent methodological advancements enable us to predict treatment effects at the individual level. We employed causal forest to explore the relationship between PRSs and individual risk of diseases associated with certain environmental factors. Following simulations illustrating its performance, we applied our approach to investigate the individual risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including coronary artery diseases (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), associated with obesity and smoking among individuals from UK Biobank (UKB; n = 369,942) and BioBank Japan (BBJ; n = 149,421). Here we find the heterogeneous association of obesity and smoking with diseases across PRS values, complicated by the multi-dimensional combination of individual characteristics such as age and sex. The highest positive correlations of PRSs and the exposure-related disease risks are observed between obesity and T2D in UKB and between smoking and CAD in BBJ (Spearman's ρ = 0.61 and 0.32, respectively). However, most relationships are weak or negative, suggesting that high-PRS groups will not necessarily benefit most from environmental factor prevention. Our study highlights the importance of individual-level prediction of disease risks associated with target exposure in precision medicine.","Tatsuhiko Naito, Kosuke Inoue, Shinichi Namba, Kyuto Sonehara, Ken Suzuki, NA NA, Koichi Matsuda, Naoki Kondo, Tatsushi Toda, Toshimasa Yamauchi, Takashi Kadowaki, Yukinori Okada","Communications medicine","2024Sep20",NA

A knowledge gap remains regarding resorbable biosynthetic onlay mesh and mesh exposure. We aim to determine exposure rate, risk factors, and treatment options. A single-center, two-surgeon retrospective review was performed examining patients who underwent VHR with onlay, Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) mesh from 2015 to 2021. Demographics, operative characteristics, outcomes, and mesh exposure management were analyzed. Of 346 patients, 15 (4.3%) experienced mesh exposure. The mean age was 53 years and BMI of 33.6 kg/m2. Patients were majority ASA class 3 (65%), female (64.2%), and averaged a defect size of 307.9 ± 235.2 cm2. Independent risk factors included diabetes (AOR = 4.3,CI 1.5-12.5;p < 0.005) and COPD (AOR = 5.2,CI 1.3-21.8;p = 0.02). Mesh exposures were identified as outpatient (20%) or intraoperative (80%). All underwent operative debridement, in which nine were managed with skin reclosure, two with partial closure, and four healed by secondary intention. Five patients required excision of unincorporated mesh. Four patients required further debridement from chronic surgical site occurrences; however, all mesh exposure patents healed after a mean of 260.8 ± 313.2 days and retained original mesh. The recurrence rate was 6.7% for mesh exposure patients. When faced with mesh exposure, resorbable biosynthetic mesh placed in onlay fashion was retained in all patients. Patients with a history of diabetes or COPD have increased risk of mesh exposure and should be counseled.","Chris Amro, Isabel Ryan, Mehdi S Lemdani, Corey M Bascone, Phoebe B McAuliffe, Abhishek A Desai, J Reed McGraw, Robyn B Broach, Stephen J Kovach, John P Fischer","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","2024Sep21",NA

"39304443","Implementation of a penicillin allergy protocol in open abdominal wall reconstruction: Preoperative optimization program.","Beta-lactam prophylaxis is the first-line preoperative antibiotic in open abdominal wall reconstruction. However, of the 11% patients reporting a penicillin allergy (PA), most receive second-line, non-β-lactam prophylaxis. Previously, abdominal wall reconstruction research from our institution demonstrated increased wound complications, readmissions, and reoperations with non-β-lactam prophylaxis. Therefore, a collaborative quality improvement initiative was developed with the infectious disease service, and a penicillin allergy protocol was instituted that stratified patients' risk of allergic reaction with a goal to increase β-lactam prophylaxis use. The effect of the penicillin allergy protocol on open abdominal wall reconstruction outcomes was prospectively evaluated. Patients with penicillin allergy undergoing open abdominal wall reconstruction were identified and grouped according to penicillin allergy protocol implementation. Pre-penicillin allergy protocol underwent open abdominal wall reconstruction before January 1, 2020, predominantly receiving non-β-lactam prophylaxis; post-penicillin allergy protocol underwent open abdominal wall reconstruction between January 1, 2020-November 1, 2023, predominantly receiving β-lactam prophylaxis. Incidence of surgical site infection was the primary outcome. Standard and inferential statistical analyses were performed. Of 315 patients with penicillin allergy, 250 underwent open abdominal wall reconstruction pre-penicillin allergy protocol and 65 post-penicillin allergy protocol. Pre- and post-penicillin allergy protocol were similar in allergic reaction severity history, sex, race, age, diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, hernia defect size, and mesh type (P > .05). Post-penicillin allergy protocol had lower body mass index (33.4 ± 7.9 vs 29.8 ± 5.3 kg/m2; P = .002) and fewer active smokers (12.4% vs 1.5%; P = .019). Expectedly, post-penicillin allergy protocol received more β-lactam prophylaxis (22.8% vs 83.1%; P < .001) and no antibiotic-induced allergic reactions. Post-penicillin allergy protocol had significantly fewer surgical site infections (24.4% vs 3.1%; P < .001), wound breakdown (16.0% vs 3.1%; P = .004), reoperations (19.2% vs 0.0%; P < .001), and readmissions (25.3% vs 9.2%; P = .006) but no statistically significant reduction in recurrence (8.4% vs 1.5%; P = .057). The penicillin allergy protocol safely increased the number of patients with penicillin allergy undergoing open abdominal wall reconstruction receiving β-lactam prophylaxis and decreased the rate of surgical site infections, wound complications, reoperations, and readmissions. These data supported the systemwide implementation of the penicillin allergy protocol for both general and orthopedic surgery, which has been incorporated into the electronic medical record of 13 hospitals within the system.","Alexis M Holland, William R Lorenz, Ansley B Ricker, Brittany S Mead, Gregory T Scarola, Bradley R Davis, Kevin R Kasten, Kent W Kercher, Rupal Jaffa, Lisa E Davidson, Michael S Boger, Vedra A Augenstein, B Todd Heniford","Surgery","2024Sep19",NA

Outcomes of interest included 30-day occurrence of reoperation, readmission, and surgical and medical complications. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with postoperative complications. A total of 1019 patients were included, with a mean age and BMI of 42.8 ± 10.9 years and 25.7 ± 5.8 kg/m², respectively. Complications occurred in 142 (14.0%) cases, with 103 (10.1%) reoperations and 51 (5.0%) readmissions. 62 (6.3%) surgical complications were recorded, the majority of which were superficial incisional infection (n = 19; 1.9%) and organ space infections (n = 19; 1.9%). Medical complications were rare (n = 13; 1.3%). Multivariable analyses revealed that higher BMI was significantly associated with any (OR:1.06, P < .0001), surgical (OR:1.08, P < .0001), and medical complications (OR:1.08, P = .04).

Both groups were divided into training and testing cohorts at an 8:2 ratio. After data standardization and the exclusion of features with Pearson correlation coefficients of |r| ≥ 0.9, independent logistic regression models were constructed using selected radiomics features of the proximal PCAT of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex (LCX) artery, and right coronary artery (RCA) via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) techniques. An integrated PCAT radiomics model including all three coronary arteries was also developed. Five models, including individual PCAT radiomics models for the LAD artery, LCX artery, and RCA; an integrated radiomics model; and a fat attenuation index (FAI) model, were assessed for diagnostic accuracy via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. Compared with the FAI model (AUC=0.564 in training, 0.518 in testing), the integrated radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC]=0.923 in training, 0.871 in testing). The AUC values of the integrated model were greater than those of the individual coronary radiomics models, with all the models showing goodness of fit (P > 0.05). The decision curves indicated greater clinical utility of the radiomics models than the FAI model.

Plaque volumes were assessed using semiautomated software, calculating total, noncalcified, calcified and low-attenuation noncalcified plaque volumes. Linear regression models, adjusted for ASSIGN score, segment involvement score and body mass index, evaluated associations between inflammatory markers and plaque volume changes. The mean±SD age was 65.4±8.4 years, with 129 (80.6%) male participants. Baseline total plaque volume was 1394 (1036, 1993) mm³. After 12 months, total plaque volume changed by 78 (-114, 244) mm³.

We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

"39304234","Population attributable fractions for risk factors for dementia in seven Latin American countries: an analysis using cross-sectional survey data.","Approximately 40% of dementia cases worldwide are attributable to 12 potentially modifiable risk factors. However, the proportion attributable to these risks in Latin America remains unknown. We aimed to determine the population attributable fraction (PAF) of 12 modifiable risk factors for dementia in seven countries in Latin America. We used data from seven cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys with measurements of 12 modifiable risk factors for dementia (less education, hearing loss, hypertension, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol intake, air pollution, and traumatic brain injury) done in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru. Data were collected between 2015 and 2021. Sample sizes ranged from 5995 to 107 907 participants (aged ≥18 years). We calculated risk factor prevalence and communalities in each country and used relative risks from previous meta-analyses to derive weighted PAFs. Pooled PAFs for Latin America were obtained using random effect meta-analyses. The overall proportion of dementia cases attributed to 12 modifiable risk factors varied across Latin American countries: weighted PAF 61·8% (95% CI 37·9-79·5) in Chile, 59·6% (35·8-77·3) in Argentina, 55·8% (35·7-71·5) in Mexico, 55·5% (35·9-70·4) in Bolivia, 53·6% (33·0-69·3) in Honduras, 48·2% (28·1-63·9) in Brazil, and 44·9% (25·8-61·2) in Peru. The overall PAF for dementia was 54·0% (48·8-59·6) for Latin America. The highest weighted PAFs in Latin American countries overall were for obesity (7%), physical inactivity (6%), and depression (5%). The estimated PAFs for Latin American countries were higher than previous global estimates. Obesity, physical inactivity, and depression were the main risk factors for dementia across seven Latin American countries. These findings have implications for public health and individually targeted dementia prevention strategies in Latin America. Although these results provide new information about Latin American countries, demographics and representativeness variations across surveys should be considered when interpreting these findings.

This cross-sectional study included 330 adults with T2DM and overweight/obesity. The participants completed questionnaires on diabetes distress, sleep quality, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and positive and negative affect. A cluster analysis was performed to identify different patterns of diabetes distress and one-way ANOVA was used to investigate the differences in physical and psychological outcomes between profiles. 30.6% of patients were identified as moderately to highly distressed, with the regimen-related distress found to be the most prominent. The Cluster analysis revealed four distinct clusters: (1) ""comprehensively exhausted profile""; (2) ""strained profile""; (3) ""high internal anguish profile""; (4) ""unperturbed profile"". The measures of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, positive and negative affect and self-efficacy differ between clusters. This study identified important differences that existed in patterns of diabetes distress among people with T2DM and overweight/obesity, and this variation can be utilized to tailor intervention strategies to the particular needs of different subgroups within individuals with T2DM.","Yiyun Zhang, Dan Zhang, Tianxue Long, Yi Wu, Jing Huang, Yating Zhang, Mingzi Li","Diabetes research and clinical practice","2024Sep19",NA

Data were obtained on age, sex, body mass index, side involved, nerves involved, number of nerves involved per attack, number of attacks per patient, number of bilateral, recurrent, and hereditary cases. Mean age was 42.7 years, 218 patients (61%) were male, mean body mass index was 23.8, the right side was involved in 232 cases (65%) Inflammatory mononeuropathy (MN) was the most frequent elementary nerve lesion, It was unique (UMN) in 253 patients (71%), and multiple (MMN) in 102 (29%), with a total of 495.neuropathies, and a mean of 2.38 nerves involved in one patient with multiple mononeuropathy (MMN). Five nerves are more frequently involved: long thoracic (n=138), supra-scapular (n=129), anterior interosseous (n=53), spinal accessory (SAN) (n=51), lateral antebrachial cutaneous (n=41) nerves. Other nerves (axillary, posterior interosseous, sensory median, phrenic, ulnar and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves, and lumbo-sacral plexus) are less frequently involved, and less suggestive for NAPT diagnosis. Bilateral, recurrent and hereditary cases were observed in 22, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. The clinical patterns of NAPT in ambulatory care thorough an EDX consultation, have showed that unique mononeuropathy (UMN) are more frequent than MMN, what results in milder cases; and that five nerves lesions are more frequent and more suggestive of NAPT.","Paul Seror","Joint bone spine","2024Sep18",NA

Only 5% of patients followed the Mediterranean diet. Among patients who had tried a diet, 51% reported a decrease in pain. Overall, 42% of patients identified at least one food or beverage that increased or decreased pain. On multivariable analyses, dieting or the perceived effect of food on pain was associated with health beliefs (positive or negative), the use of complementary and alternative medicines, and lack of support or information from healthcare professionals.

In this study we examined risk factors for development of AAA in patients with diabetes. Adults over 50 years with diabetes who underwent health screening between 2009 and 2012 were followed for incident AAA until December 31, 2019. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors associated with AAA. Among 1,913,066 participants (55.3% men), 6,996 AAA cases were identified during a mean follow-up of 7.7 years.

"39303404","Geniculate ganglion diverticulum: a potential imaging marker in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.","The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is often challenging in patients who do not present with classic symptoms. Brain MRI can play a pivotal role, as several imaging findings, such as an empty sella appearance (ESA), have been shown to be associated with IIH. Yet, none of the MRI signs have been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that presence of a geniculate ganglion diverticulum (GGD) is a potential imaging marker for the detection of IIH. This is an IRB-approved, single-institution, retrospective, observational study. Brain MRI examinations of patients referred to Radiology by Otology clinic over a period of 10 years were reviewed. 244 MRI exams fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently screened for the presence of GGD and ESA by two Neuroradiology fellows. Electronic medical records (EMR) of patients in this study were reviewed for presence of clinical manifestations of IIH. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to estimate the accuracy of each covariate in diagnosing IIH. The area under each ROC curve (AUC) was calculated to identify an accurate prognostic covariate. Statistical analysis was done using R programming language V 4.2.2. GGD was identified in MRI exams of 51 patients. A 2:1 propensity score (PS) matching for age, gender, and Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to select non-GGD control group for comparison with the GGD group. There was strong agreement between the 2 reviewers (kappa = 0.81, agreement = 95 %). Twelve patients in this study were diagnosed with IIH. There was a high incidence of GGD (OR = 12.19, 95 % CI (2.56, 58.10)) and ESA (OR = 4.97, 95 % CI (1.47, 16.74)) in IIH patients. The AUC observed in GGD for predicting IIH was 0.771 (0.655-0.888), specificity = 0.709 (0.638-0.780), and sensitivity = 0.833 (0.583-1). The AUC observed for ESA in predicting IIH was 0.682 (0.532-0.831), specificity = 0.780 (0.709-0.844), and sensitivity = 0.583 (0.333-0.833). GGD is potentially a novel imaging marker of IIH with sensitivity higher than and specificity comparable to that of ESA. Presence of GGD should raise the possibility of IIH.","Sachin Chitalkar, Dipak Thakor, Ali Sheikhy, Jamie Cole, Sarah Fangmeyer, Fatemeh Nasri, Abdelmonem Ahmed, Ashkan Monfared, Md Reza Taheri","Clinical imaging","2024Sep11",NA
"39303379","Overnutrition and associated factors among women of reproductive age in Sub-Saharan Africa: A hierarchical analysis of 2019-2023 standard demographic and health survey data.","Overnutrition, a leading cause of global mortality, has seen a significant rise in low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. Despite emerging evidence linking overnutrition to non-communicable diseases, limited action has been taken to address this issue. While undernutrition studies have received more attention, research on overnutrition and women's health remains scarce in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study aims to assess the prevalence and associated factors of overnutrition among reproductive women in this region METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2019-2023 Demographic and Health Survey datasets in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study included a weighted sample of 65,161 women aged 15-49 y. Using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, we identified factors associated with overnutrition. The adjusted odds ratio, along with a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of p < 0.05, determined the statistical significance of the explanatory variables. The pooled prevalence of overnutrition among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa was 34.79% (95% CI: 34.42-35.16). Specifically, the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 21.81% and 12.99%, respectively. Women's educational status, age, media use, household wealth, urbanization, community poverty, and country income level were significantly associated with higher odds of overnutrition. The prevalence of overnutrition among women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa is relatively high. Key factors associated with this issue include women's educational status, age, media utilization, household wealth, place of residence, community poverty level, and national income status. These multilevel determinants highlight the need for a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to address overnutrition in this population. Effective strategies should target individual behaviors while considering broader social, economic, and environmental contexts. Integrating overnutrition prevention into maternal and reproductive health services, as well as strengthening social protection measures, are recommended steps to tackle this growing challenge in sub-Saharan Africa.","Tadesse Tarik Tamir, Enyew Getaneh Mekonen, Belayneh Shetie Workneh, Masresha Asmare Techane, Bewuketu Terefe, Alebachew Ferede Zegeye","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)","2024Aug24",NA

The study sample comprised 70 healthy female participants, including 27 perimenopausal (49.8 ± 3.8 years) and 43 postmenopausal (55.7 ± 4 years) individuals. Validated methods were used to assess physical activity level, quality of life, climacteric symptoms, and anthropometric data. Arterial stiffness parameters were measured using Mobil-O-Graph. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) had a higher mean in the postmenopausal group than in the perimenopause group [8.04 m/s (SD 0.79) vs 7.01 m/s (SD 0.78), p < .001). PWV was strongly correlated with peripheral (r = 0.619) and central (r = 0.632) Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) in postmenopausal group and an even stronger correlation was observed in perimenopausal group (r = 0.779 pSBP and 0.782 cSBP). BMI was a risk predictor in the perimenopausal group contributing positively to increase Pulse Pressure Amplification (PPA) (0.458, p < .05). In postmenopausal women, heart rate (HR) was a stronger predictor for central SBP, cardiac output, and total vascular resistance, whereas perimenopausal women HR influenced central diastolic blood pressure and PPA. Vascular changes initiating during perimenopause may contribute to the development of cardiovascular pathologies in the postmenopausal period. Further research with larger, representative samples is warranted to corroborate these findings.","Gleisy Kelly Neves Gonçalves, Thaize Prates Ferreira, Laís Alzamora Cópio, César Teixeira Castilho, Márcio Alexandre Hipólito Rodrigues, Maria da Glória Rodrigues-Machado","Women & health","2024Sep20",NA
"39302230","Determinants of cerebral blood flow and arterial transit time in healthy older adults.","Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT), markers of brain vascular health, worsen with age. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify modifiable determinants of CBF and ATT in healthy older adults (n = 78, aged 60-81 years). Associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and CBF or ATT were of particular interest because the impact of cardiorespiratory fitness is not clear within existing literature. Secondly, this study assessed whether CBF or ATT relate to cognitive function in older adults. Multiple post-labelling delay pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling estimated resting CBF and ATT in grey matter. Results from multiple linear regressions found higher BMI was associated with lower global CBF (β = -0.35, P = 0.008) and a longer global ATT (β = 0.30, P = 0.017), global ATT lengthened with increasing age (β = 0.43, P = 0.004), and higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with longer ATT in parietal (β = 0.44, P = 0.004) and occipital (β = 0.45, P = 0.003) regions. Global or regional CBF or ATT were not associated with processing speed, working memory, or attention. In conclusion, preventing excessive weight gain may help attenuate age-related declines in brain vascular health. ATT may be more sensitive to age-related decline than CBF, and therefore useful for early detection and management of cerebrovascular impairment. Finally, cardiorespiratory fitness appears to have little effect on CBF but may induce longer ATT in specific regions.","Jack Feron, Katrien Segaert, Foyzul Rahman, Sindre H Fosstveit, Kelsey E Joyce, Ahmed Gilani, Hilde Lohne-Seiler, Sveinung Berntsen, Karen J Mullinger, Samuel J E Lucas","Aging","2024Sep18",NA
"39302228","The relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and epicardial fat thickness, and serum levels of chemerin, adropin, and betatrophin.","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are highly prevalent among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between RA and epicardial fat thickness (EFT), as well as serum betatrophin, chemerin and adropin levels. This cross-sectional study included 80 patients (62 women and 18 men) diagnosed with RA according to the American College of Rheumatology/The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR/EULAR) 2010 RA classification criteria and 80 healthy controls (64 women and 16 men). Exclusion criteria comprised other autoimmune diseases, CVDs, diabetes mellitus, other endocrine disorders, acute or chronic pancreatic disorders, malignancy, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or antihyperlipidemic drug usage. Serum betatrophin, chemerin and adropin concentrations were measured. Epicardial fat thickness was evaluated with transthoracic echocardiography. Adropin levels were significantly lower in the RA group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Chemerin levels and EFT were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (p = 0.016, p < 0.001, respectively). When assessing the relationship between biomarkers and EFT in RA patients, a strong positive correlation was observed between chemerin and EFT (r = 0.73, p = 0.046) in patients with high disease activity. Epicardial fat thickness, as an indicator of cardiovascular involvement, is higher in patients with RA. Moreover, high chemerin levels and low adropin levels in these patients may be indicative of cardiovascular involvement.","Bilge Ekinci, Cuma Mertoglu, Resit Coskun, Yusuf Kemal Arslan, Taha Abdulkadir Coban, Fatih Ozcicek","Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University","2024Sep20",NA
"39302069","The association between exposure to famine in early life and risks of diabetic complications in adult patients with type two diabetes.","In this study, we aimed to assess the associations between early exposure to famine and the risks of diabetic complications in adult patients with type two diabetes. The participants in this study were selected from China National HbA1c Surveillance System (2009-13) and further stratified according to the birth year. The participants born between 1956-59, 1959-61, and 1962-64 were classified as foetal exposed group with 70 852, infant/toddler exposed group with 93 616, and unexposed group with 72 723 participants. The association between exposure to famine in early life and risks of diabetic complications were analysed by logistic regression. We assessed the attributing effects of the interaction between exposure to famine in early life and modifiable risk factors by the multiplicative and additive interactive models. After adjustments for sex, famine severity, economic status in adulthood, body mass index, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin, diabetes duration, and the use of antidiabetic agents, the increased risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; 95% CI (confidence interval) = 1.26, 1.36), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.24, 1.41), and diabetic retinopathy (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.10) were observed in patients with early-life exposure to famine. The reduced risk of diabetic kidney disease (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90, 0.99) was observed in patients with early-life exposure to famine compared with those without famine exposure. The interaction analyses indicated that obesity might exacerbate the increased risk of coronary heart disease (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.22, 1.30), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.21, 1.32), and diabetic retinopathy associated with early-life exposure to famine (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.12) in patients with type two diabetes. Moreover, high economic status in adulthood might also exacerbate the increased risk of coronary heart disease (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.30, 1.40) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.23, 1.43) associated with early-life exposure to famine in patients with type two diabetes. Early-life exposure to famine in patients with type two diabetes might be associated with increased risks of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy but a reduced risk of diabetic kidney disease in adulthood. Obesity and high economic status might further exacerbate the risk of diabetic complications associated with early-life exposure to famine. Improving early-life nutritional status may promote better risk prevention and management of diabetic complications in patients with type two diabetes.","Chu Lin, Xiaoling Cai, Zonglin Li, Fang Lv, Wenjia Yang, Linong Ji","Journal of global health","2024Sep20","Humans; Female; Male; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Middle Aged; China; Risk Factors; Famine; Diabetes Complications; Adult; Aged; Diabetic Retinopathy; Infant"
"39301869","Investigating an appropriate indicator of acute kidney injury for patient prognosis following lung transplantation.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between different subtypes of acute kidney injury (AKI) and clinical outcomes following lung transplantation (LTx) and to identify a reliable indicator for predicting poor prognosis in the LTx population. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 279 LTx patients from August 2016 to March 2023. The AKI subtypes included AKI, persistent AKI on Day 7 (P7-AKI) and Day 14 (P14-AKI) after LTx, and AKI stages. The correlations of these factors with respiratory outcomes, mortality at 90 days, mortality at 1 year and data finalization were assessed, and the risk factors for the selected AKI subtypes were evaluated. AKI occurred in 215 patients (77.1%), with 129 (46.2%) experiencing P7-AKI and 95 (34.1%) experiencing P14-AKI. P7-AKI was associated with more respiratory and mortality outcomes than were AKI and AKI stages, and P7-AKI surpassed P14-AKI in terms of a shorter diagnostic time. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, type of transplant, transplant diagnosis and comorbidities, P7-AKI independently correlated with increased mortality risk at 90 days [HR 12.312 (95% CI: 2.839-53.402)], 1 year [HR 3.847 (95% CI: 1.840-8.044)], and data finalization [HR 2.010 (95% CI: 1.331-3.033)]. Five variables were identified as independent predictors for P7-AKI, including preoperative body mass index, prothrombin activity, hemoglobin and serum creatinine, and intraoperative colloid administration. P7-AKI has been identified as a reliable indicator for predicting adverse outcomes in LTx patients, which may assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals.","Wenwen Du, Dan Zhang, Wenqian Chen, Wenhui Chen, Pengmei Li, Xiaoxing Wang","Renal failure","2024Dec","Humans; Acute Kidney Injury; Female; Male; Lung Transplantation; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Prognosis; Adult; Risk Factors; Postoperative Complications"
"39301685","Risk of dyslipidaemia in people living with HIV who are taking tenofovir alafenamide: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Among many antiretroviral drugs, tenofovir alafenamide is used extensively in combination regimens of tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir/emtricitabine/bictegravir. However, concerns have arisen about the potential of tenofovir alafenamide to exacerbate hyperlipidaemia. This meta-analysis evaluates the relationship between tenofovir alafenamide use and lipid-profile alterations in people living with HIV. We searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify studies on changes in cholesterol levels (e.g. total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) in people living with HIV who received treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide (data collected 31 March 2023, review completed 30 July 2023). Potential risk factors for worsening lipid profile during treatment with tenofovir alafenamide were also evaluated. Sixty-five studies involving 39,713 people living with HIV were selected. Significant increases in total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed after treatment with tenofovir alafenamide. Specifically, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+12.31 mg/dl) and total cholesterol (+18.86 mg/dl) increased markedly from the third month of tenofovir alafenamide use, with significant elevations observed across all time points up to 36 months. Comparatively, tenofovir alafenamide regimens resulted in higher lipid levels than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimens at 12 months of use. Notably, discontinuation of the tenofovir alafenamide regimen led to significant decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-9.31 mg/dl) and total cholesterol (-8.91 mg/dl).

"39301664","Identification and Potential Clinical Utility of Common Genetic Variants in Gestational Diabetes among Chinese Pregnant Women.","The genetic basis for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy remain unclear. This study aimed to uncover the genetic determinants of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and investigate their applications. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for GDM in Chinese women (464 cases and 1,217 controls), followed by de novo replications in an independent Chinese cohort (564 cases and 572 controls) and in silico replication in European (12,332 cases and 131,109 controls) and multi-ethnic populations (5,485 cases and 347,856 controls). A polygenic risk score (PRS) was derived based on the identified variants. Using the genome-wide scan and candidate gene approaches, we identified four susceptibility loci for GDM. These included three previously reported loci for GDM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at MTNR1B (rs7945617, odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.38 to 1.96]), CDKAL1 (rs7754840, OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.58), and INS-IGF2-KCNQ1 (rs2237897, OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.79), as well as a novel genome-wide significant locus near TBR1-SLC4A10 (rs117781972, OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.62; Pmeta=7.6×10-9), which has not been previously reported in GWAS for T2DM or glycaemic traits. Moreover, we found that women with a high PRS (top quintile) had over threefold (95% CI, 2.30 to 4.09; Pmeta=3.1×10-14) and 71% (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.71; P=0.0220) higher risk for GDM and abnormal glucose tolerance post-pregnancy, respectively, compared to other individuals. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of glucose metabolism exhibits both similarities and differences between the pregnant and non-pregnant states.

"39301623","High‑fat diet‑induced LCN2 exacerbates myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion injury by enhancing platelet activation.","Following acute myocardial infarction, the recovery of blood flow leads to myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion (MI/R) injury, which is primarily characterized by the activation of inflammatory signals, microvascular obstruction, increased oxidative stress and excessive Ca2+ overload. It has also been demonstrated that platelets can exacerbate MI/R injury by releasing reactive oxygen species, inflammatory factors and chemokines, while also obstructing microvessels through thrombus formation. As a bioactive molecule with proinflammatory and chemotactic properties, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) exhibits a positive correlation with obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance index, which are all significant risk factors for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Notably, the potential role of LCN2 in promoting atherosclerosis may be related to its influence on the function of macrophages, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, but its effect on platelet function has not yet been reported. In the present study, the effect of a high‑fat diet (HFD) on LCN2 expression was determined by detecting LCN2 expression levels in the liver and serum samples of mice through reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The effect of LCN2 on platelet function was evaluated by examining whether LCN2 affected platelet activation, aggregation, adhesion, clot retraction and P‑selectin expression. To determine whether LCN2 aggravated MI/R injury in HFD‑fed mice by affecting platelet and inflammatory cell recruitment, wild‑type and LCN2 knockout mice fed a HFD were subjected to MI/R injury, then hearts were collected for hematoxylin and eosin staining and 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of CD42b, Ly6G, CD3 and B220. Based on observing the upregulation of LCN2 expression in mice fed a HFD, the present study further confirmed that LCN2 could accelerate platelet activation, aggregation and adhesion. Moreover, in vivo studies validated that knockout of LCN2 not only mitigated MI/R injury, but also inhibited the recruitment of platelets and inflammatory cells in myocardial tissue following ischemia‑reperfusion. In conclusion, the current findings suggested that the effect of HFD‑induced LCN2 on aggravating MI/R injury may totally or partially dependent on its promotion of platelet function.","Peng Li, Juhai Chen, Mingdong Wang, Qi Wang, Xingde Liu","Molecular medicine reports","2024Nov","Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Lipocalin-2; Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; Mice; Platelet Activation; Male; Blood Platelets; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout"
"39301585","Major depression recurrence is associated with differences in obesity-related traits in women, but not in men.","Obesity-related cardiometabolic comorbidity is common in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sex differences and MDD recurrence may modify the MDD-obesity-link. Sex-specific associations of MDD recurrence (single [MDDS] or recurrent episodes [MDDR]) and obesity-related traits were analyzed in 4.100 adults (51.6% women) from a cross-sectional population-based cohort in Germany (SHIP-Trend-0). DSM-IV-based lifetime MDD diagnoses and MDD recurrence status were obtained through diagnostic interviews. Obesity-related outcomes included anthropometrics (weight, body mass index, waist- and hip-circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio), bioelectrical impedance analysis of body fat mass and fat-free mass, and subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from abdominal magnetic resonance imaging. Sex-stratified linear regression models predicting obesity-related traits from MDD recurrence status were adjusted for age, education, and current depressive symptoms. 790 participants (19.3%) fulfilled lifetime MDD criteria (23.8% women vs. 14.5% men, p<0.001). In women, MDDS was inversely associated with anthropometric indicators of general and central obesity, while MDDR was positively associated with all obesity-related traits, except waist-to-hip ratio and fat-free mass. In women, MDDR versus MDDS was associated with higher levels of obesity across all outcomes except fat-free mass. In men, MDD was positively associated with SAT regardless of MDD recurrence. Additionally, lifetime MDD was positively associated with VAT in men. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses after exclusion of participants with current use of antidepressants. The MDD-obesity association is modified by MDD recurrence and sex independent of current depressive symptoms. Accounting for sex and MDD recurrence may identify individuals with MDD at increased cardiometabolic risk.","Urs Bannert, Ulrike Siewert-Markus, Johanna Klinger-König, Hans J Grabe, Sylvia Stracke, Marcus Dörr, Henry Völzke, Marcello R P Markus, Philipp Töpfer, Till Ittermann","European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists","2024Sep20","Humans; Male; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Obesity; Adult; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Recurrence; Sex Factors; Germany; Comorbidity; Body Mass Index"

This study investigated the reoperation rates after internal fixation with the femoral neck system (FNS). A single-institution cohort study was conducted on patients aged 18 years or older who sustained intracapsular femoral neck fractures and underwent internal fixation with a fixed-angle implant. Surgeons, patients, and investigators were not blinded. The primary outcome was any hip reoperation at the final follow-up. Secondary outcomes were to characterize a cohort of patients regarding demographics, fracture classification, intraoperative findings, postoperative fracture complications and union rates, and postoperative pain. This study found that internal fixation with FNS for intracapsular femoral neck fractures was associated with a 23% rate of revision surgery. Of the initial 94 patients who received FNS internal fixation, 44 patients were included for analysis; of those, 10 patients underwent revision surgery. Patients had a 22% rate of in-hospital medical adverse events with a 30-day readmission rate of 9%. Increasing body mass index was associated with increased revision rates (P = 0.037). Patients who sustained displaced femoral neck fractures had a significant decrease in SF-12 Mental Health Composite, SF-12 Physical Health Composite, and quality-of-life subscale scores. The FNS is a viable alternative for internal fixation of intracapsular femoral neck fractures.

"39301498","Association between fatty liver index and cardiometabolic multimorbidity: evidence from the cross-sectional national health and nutrition examination survey.","Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) contributes to the cardiometabolic diseases through multiple mechanisms. Fatty liver index (FLI) has been formulated as a non-invasive, convenient, and cost-effective approach to estimate the degree of MASLD. The current study aims to evaluate the correlation between FLI and the prevalent cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), and to assess the usefulness of FLI to improve the detection of the prevalent CMM in the general population. 26,269 subjects were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018. FLI was formulated based on triglycerides, body mass index, γ -glutamyltransferase, and waist circumference. CMM was defined as a history of 2 or more of diabetes mellitus, stroke, myocardial infarction. The prevalence of CMM was 10.84%. With adjustment of demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, and medical history covariates, each standard deviation of FLI leaded to a 58.8% risk increase for the prevalent CMM. The fourth quartile of FLI had a 2.424 times risk for the prevalent CMM than the first quartile, and a trend towards higher risk was observed. Smooth curve fitting showed that the risk for prevalent CMM increased proportionally along with the elevation of FLI. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the correlation was robust in several conventional subpopulations. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an incremental value of FLI for detecting prevalent CMM when adding it to conventional cardiometabolic risk factors (Area under the curve: 0.920 vs. 0.983, P < 0.001). Results from reclassification analysis confirmed the improvement from FLI. Our study demonstrated a positive, linear, and robust correlation between FLI and the prevalent CMM, and our findings implicate the potential usefulness of FLI to improve the detection of prevalent CMM in the general population.","Xinsheng Gu, Di Gao, Xinjian Zhou, Yueyou Ding, Wenrui Shi, Jieun Park, Shaohui Wu, Yue He","Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine","2024",NA
"39301496","Lipoprotein(a) as a novel biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes in ischemic heart failure.","Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the association between Lp(a) and adverse outcomes in patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum Lp(a) levels and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in IHF patients. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, 1,168 IHF patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were enrolled. Patients were divided into four groups based on Lp(a) quartiles. The primary endpoint was MACE, defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and any revascularization. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between Lp(a) quartiles and adverse outcomes. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve were constructed to explore the nonlinear relationship between Lp(a) levels and MACE risk. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the association in different subgroups. The incidence of MACE increased significantly across Lp(a) quartiles (Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1: 46.4% vs. 22.9%, P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the highest Lp(a) group remained independently associated with an increased risk of MACE (HR, 95% CI: 2.28, 1.69-3.07, P < 0.001, P for trend <0.001), all-cause mortality (HR, 95% CI: 2.33, 1.54-3.54, P < 0.001, P for trend = 0.01), and any revascularization (HR, 95% CI: 2.18, 1.35-3.53, P = 0.002, P for trend = 0.001). The RCS model demonstrated a nonlinear positive relationship between Lp(a) levels and MACE risk. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction with body mass index (BMI), with a more pronounced association observed in patients with higher BMI (P for interaction <0.001). Elevated Lp(a) levels were independently associated with an increased risk of MACE, mortality, and revascularization in IHF patients, with a stronger effect in obese individuals.","Biyang Zhang, Yinxiao Xu, Xin Huang, Tienan Sun, Meishi Ma, Zheng Chen, Yujie Zhou","Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine","2024",NA

This study investigated the prognostic relationship of stress hyperglycemia on critically ill patients with CS. We included 393 critically ill patients with CS from the MIMIC IV database in this study and categorized the patients into four groups based on quartiles of Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR). We assessed the correlation between SHR and mortality using restricted cubic spline analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. The primary outcomes observed were ICU mortality and hospitalization mortality. The mean age of the entire study population was 68 years, of which 30% were male (118 cases). There was no significant difference between the four groups in terms of age, gender, BMI, and vital signs (P>0.05). There was an increasing trend in the levels of lactate (lac), white blood cell count (WBC), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), glucose and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) from group Q1 to group Q2, with the greatest change in patients in group Q4 (P<0.05) and the patients in group Q4 had the highest use of mechanical ventilation, the longest duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay.

"39301319","Effect of post-traumatic stress disorder on type 2 diabetes and the mediated effect of obesity: a Mendelian randomization study.","Whether the role of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on type 2 diabetes (T2D) is mediated by obesity or other mediating factors is controversial. This study was designed to assess the impact of PTSD on genetic susceptibility to T2D and mediating factors. The datasets for PTSD, T2D, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, and alcohol consumption were obtained from genome-wide association studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess exposure-outcome causality, and inverse variance weighted was used as the primary tool for MR analysis. MR-Egger intercept, Cochran's Q, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis were employed to assess horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and robustness, respectively. The MR analysis showed that PTSD was associated with increased genetic susceptibility to T2D (OR, 1.036; 95% CI, 1.008-1.064; p = 0.011), obesity (OR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.016-1.050; p < 0.001), and hypertension (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.000-1.003; p = 0.015), but not not with genetic susceptibility to hyperlipidemia, alcohol consumption, and smoking status (p ≥ 0.05). Mediated effect analysis showed that PTSD increased genetic susceptibility to T2D by increasing genetic susceptibility to obesity and hypertension, with obesity accounting for 9.51% and hypertension accounting for 2.09%. MR-Egger intercept showed no horizontal pleiotropy (p ≥ 0.05). Cochran's Q showed no heterogeneity (p ≥ 0.05). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. This MR analysis suggests that PTSD increases the risk of T2D and that this effect is partially mediated by obesity and hypertension. Active prevention and treatment of PTSD can help reduce the risk of T2D.","Yunfeng Yu, Gang Hu, Xinyu Yang, Siyang Bai, Jingyi Wu, Keke Tong, Rong Yu","Frontiers in endocrinology","2024","Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Obesity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hypertension; Risk Factors"

Variables included patient medical and demographics as well as county-level metrics. Comparisons of patients who returned to clinic and those who were lost to follow-up were assessed by chi-square for categorical variables and Student's t-test/Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous normal/skewed variables, respectively. Univariate logistic regression modeling identified risk factors for coming lost to follow-up and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported with a 2-sided P-value for significance of <.05. A total of 524 patients were included in the analysis. Almost one-fourth of patients were lost to follow-up (24.6%). The odds of returning to clinic were higher in patients with the Children's Health Insurance Plan, who were prescribed endocrine medications, who had a concurrent diagnosis of cholesterol disorder, who had referral to the endocrine clinic before COVID-19, and who were offered a telehealth visit. No other assessed variable was significantly associated with the likelihood of returning to clinic.

"39301245","Association of ambient air pollutant mixtures with IVF/ICSI-ET clinical pregnancy rates during critical exposure periods.","Does exposure to a mixture of ambient air pollutants during specific exposure periods influence clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF/ICSI-embryo transfer (ET) cycles? The specific exposure period from ET to the serum hCG test was identified as a critical exposure window as exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2) or a combination of air pollutants was associated with a decreased likelihood of clinical pregnancy. Exposure to a single pollutant may impact pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing ART. However, in daily life, individuals often encounter mixed pollution, and limited research exists on the effects of mixed air pollutants and the specific exposure periods. This retrospective cohort study involved infertile patients who underwent their initial IVF/ICSI-ET cycle at an assisted reproduction center between January 2020 and January 2023. Exclusions were applied for patients meeting specific criteria, such as no fresh ET, incomplete clinical and address information, residency outside the 17 cities in the Sichuan Basin, age over 45 years, use of donor semen, thin endometrium (<8 mm) and infertility factors unrelated to tubal or ovulation issues. In total, 5208 individuals were included in the study. Daily average levels of six air pollutants (fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), SO2, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3)) were acquired from air quality monitoring stations. The cumulative average levels of various pollutants were determined using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method across four distinct exposure periods (Period 1: 90 days before oocyte retrieval; Period 2: oocyte retrieval to ET; Period 3: ET to serum hCG test; Period 4: 90 days before oocyte retrieval to serum hCG test). Single-pollutant logistic regression, two-pollutant logistic regression, Quantile g-computation (QG-C) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were employed to evaluate the influence of pollutants on clinical pregnancy rates. Stratified analyses were executed to discern potentially vulnerable populations. The clinical pregnancy rate for participants during the study period was 54.53%. Single-pollutant logistic models indicated that for PM2.5 during specific exposure Period 1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.99) and specific exposure Period 4 (aOR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-0.98), and SO2 in specific exposure Period 3 (aOR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.99), each interquartile range (IQR) increment exhibited an association with a decreased probability of clinical pregnancy. Consistent results were observed with dual air pollution models. In the multi-pollution analysis, QG-C indicated a 12% reduction in clinical pregnancy rates per IQR increment of mixed pollutants during specific exposure Period 3 (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). Among these pollutants, SO2 (33.40%) and NO2 (33.40%) contributed the most to the negative effects. The results from BKMR and QG-C were consistent. Stratified analysis revealed increased susceptibility to ambient air pollution among individuals who underwent transfer of two embryos, those with BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 and those under 35 years old. Caution was advised in interpreting the results due to the retrospective nature of the study, which was prone to selection bias from non-random sampling. Smoking and alcohol, known confounding factors in IVF/ICSI-ET, were not accounted for. Only successful cycles that reached the hCG test were included, excluding a few patients who did not reach the ET stage. While IDW was used to estimate pollutant concentrations at residential addresses, data on participants' work locations and activity patterns were not collected, potentially affecting the accuracy of exposure prediction. Exposure to a mixture of pollutants, spanning from ET to the serum hCG test (Period 3), appeared to be correlated with a diminished probability of achieving clinical pregnancy. This association suggested a potential impact of mixed pollutants on the interaction between embryos and the endometrium, as well as embryo implantation during this critical stage, potentially contributing to clinical pregnancy failure. This underscored the importance of providing women undergoing ART with comprehensive information to comprehend the potential environmental influences and motivating them to adopt suitable protective measures when feasible, thereby mitigating potential adverse effects of contaminants on reproductive health.

The healing quality and healing time, the positive rate of bacterial culture after bone cement coating, the loosening rate of bone cement, the number of operations, the number of hospitalizations, the length of hospitalization, and the cost of hospitalization were recorded and compared between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the positive rate of bacterial culture after bone cement coating and the loosening rate of bone cement in the improved group was significantly lower, as well as the number of operations, the number of hospitalizations, the length of hospitalization, and hospitalization cost significantly reduced ( P<0.05). Wound repair was completed in both groups without amputation. The wound healing quality of the improved group was better than that of the control group and the wound healing time was shorter, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). All patients were followed up 1-5 years (mean 3.4 years), and no ulcers recurred during follow-up. Debridement-VSD-modified external fixation antibiotic-impregnated cement semi-open technique in the treatment of chronic ulcer wounds can effectively reduce the loosening rate of bone cement, facilitate the induced membrane formation and wound healing, and significantly reduce the number of operations and shorten the length of hospital stay.","Jinluan Lin, Yun Xie, Lifeng Zheng, Kaibin Fang, Jianhua Lin","Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery","2024Sep15","Humans; Retrospective Studies; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bone Cements; Debridement; Wound Healing; Chronic Disease; Male; Female; Treatment Outcome; Drainage; Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy; Middle Aged"

The clinical data of 128 patients with anteromedial osteoarthritis who underwent mobile-bearing medial UKA between June 2019 and June 2021 was retrospectively analyzed. According to the integrity of ACL structure under direct vision during operation, the patients were divided into normal group (30 cases), synovial defect group (53 cases), and longitudinal split group (45 cases). There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, preoperative knee range of motion (ROM), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and other baseline data among the 3 groups ( P>0.05). The knee ROM, KSS score (including clinical and functional scores), WOMAC score (including pain, stiffness, and function scores) before operation and at last follow-up, the Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Forgetting Joint Score (FJS-12) at last follow-up were recorded and compared among the 3 groups. Imaging examination was performed to evaluate the wear of cartilage in the lateral tibiofemoral compartment and patellofemoral compartment of the knee joint. HKA and posterior tibial slope (PTS) were measured at last follow-up. All the patients of 3 groups were followed up 22-56 months (mean, 40.4 months). There was no significant difference in follow-up time among the 3 groups ( P>0.05). At last follow-up, imaging examination showed no obvious cartilage wear progression of the lateral tibiofemoral compartment and patellofemoral compartment, and no adverse events such as aseptic loosening of the prosthesis, dislocation of the removable pad, or infection occurred during the follow-up. At last follow-up, knee ROM, HKA, KSS scores, and WOMAC scores of the 3 groups significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the changes of the above indicators before and after operation, and also the Lysholm score, IKDC score, FJS-12 score, and PTS among the 3 groups ( P>0.05).

This study aims to evaluate the skin changes in patients with LVD using high-frequency ultrasound. Forty-five patients with LVD, who attended Henan Provincial People's Hospital from November 2021 to March 2024, were selected. According to the pathological conclusions, patients were divided into two groups: the vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) group (n = 24) and the vulvar lichen simplex chronicus (VLSC) group (n = 21). Thirty age- and BMI-matched healthy women were selected as the control group. We assessed the epidermal thickness, subepidermal low echogenic band (SLEB) thickness, dermal thickness, and vascular index (VI) among the three groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic efficacy of these ultrasound parameters for LVD. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors influencing LVD pathology in VLS patients. Epidermal thickness, SLEB thickness, dermal thickness, and VI were increased in the VLS and VLSC groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in ultrasound parameters between the VLS and VLSC groups (p > 0.05). The ROC curves showed that the area under the curve (AUC) value for the dermis (AUC = 0.882) was the largest for VLS, and VI (AUC = 0.917), it was the largest for VLSC. Binary logistic regression indicated that having an allergic disease was a risk factor for VLS between VLS and VLSC groups (OR = 6.797, p = 0.028). High-frequency ultrasound can detect thickening of the skin and increasing VI in patients with LVD, which can be helpful in the evaluation and management of LVD.","Jingyi Ma, Yan Song, Jun Xv, Kaikai Shen, Ming Wu, Jiyun Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Haohui Zhu, Xijun Zhang","Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI)","2024Sep","Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Ultrasonography; Adult; Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus; Vulvar Diseases; Neurodermatitis; Vulva; Skin; Lichenoid Eruptions; Aged; Epidermis"
"39300817","Incidence and Pitfalls of Adipose Tissue Encountered in Urinary Bladder Biopsy/Transurethral Resection Specimens.","Despite the College of American Pathologists' recommendation against diagnosing ""fat invasion"" in urinary bladder biopsies and transurethral resection of bladder tumor specimens (TURBT), some pathologists still consider this scenario as pathologic stage T3. However, a formal evaluation of fat in biopsies/TURBT has not been performed. Material obtained from TURBT is considered as clinical staging (cT) and that obtained from cystectomy is true pathologic staging (pT). Herein, we analyze adipose tissue incidence/distribution, cancer involving fat, staging ramifications, and clinical outcomes in a large series of biopsies/TURBT. Among 366 biopsies/TURBT specimens, data on adipose tissue presence, location, and quantity were analyzed. An initial analysis of 200 consecutive biopsies/TURBT specimens (including benign/cancer), adipose tissue was identified in 37% of 200 specimens (22% biopsies, 78% TURBT), primarily in the lamina propria (57%) or both lamina propria/muscularis propria (32%). A subsequent analysis of 183 invasive cancer (cT1/cT2) biopsies/TURBT revealed adipose tissue in 40% of specimens, predominantly within both the lamina propria and muscularis propria. Among all cT1/cT2 specimens, 26% (23/88) had cancer involving fat. Clinical follow-up on these putative ""cT3"" specimens revealed 10 patients who underwent radical cystectomy of which only 1 of 10 remained pT3/pT4 (although 8 patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Adipose tissue is commonly found in biopsies/TURBT, predominantly localized in the lamina propria and sometimes extending into the muscularis propria. Importantly, the presence of tumor ""invading"" fat on biopsies/TURBT does not necessarily indicate pT3 disease. This underscores the need for standardized reporting practices, emphasizing the importance of reserving pathologic staging for cystectomy specimens.","Carol N Rizkalla, Sandy Srinivas, Ankur R Sangoi","International journal of surgical pathology","2024Sep19",NA

This study aimed to systematically review the evidence comparing cardiovascular disease risk factors between patients with vitiligo and controls and to perform a meta-analysis of the results. A comprehensive database search was performed for all studies in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register databases from inception to November, 2023. The main keywords used were vitiligo, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, C-reactive protein, and homocysteine. Only observational studies and no randomized controlled trials were included. Of the 1269 studies initially selected, the full texts of 108 were assessed for eligibility, and 74 were ultimately included in the analysis. Three reviewers independently extracted the following data: study design, number and characteristics of participants, inclusion indicators, and disease duration. A meta-analysis of the single-group rates was performed for the diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity groups. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to calculate the sample-size weighted averages for the indicators included in the studies. The primary outcomes were co-morbidity analysis and co-morbidity rates of vitiligo with metabolic syndrome, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with vitiligo and cardiovascular disease. This meta-analysis concluded that comorbidities in patients with vitiligo included metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, with comorbidity rates of 28.3%, 6.0%, 38.5%, 43.0%, and 15.8%, respectively. Simultaneously, we showed that the vitiligo group differed significantly from the control group in the following aspects: fasting blood glucose, insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, smoking, and alcohol consumption. However, no significant differences were observed between the vitiligo and control groups in terms of waist circumference, body mass index, or phospholipid levels. The vast majority of the studies were from Eastern countries; therefore, extrapolation of these results to Western populations is questionable. The significant heterogeneity may be due to different protocols, doses, durations, center settings, population registries, etc., which severely compromise the validity of the results. This study summarized not only the factors associated with, but also those not associated with, cardiovascular disease in patients with vitiligo. This study provides a foundation for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with vitiligo.","Xin Liang, Fei Guo, Miao Zhang, Chunxiao Wang, Naixuan Lin, Li Liu, Yan Chen, Fang Liu, Yuhua Du, Lei Li, Xin Li","Annals of medicine","2024Dec","Vitiligo; Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Metabolic Syndrome; Hypertension; Obesity; Hyperlipidemias; Diabetes Mellitus; Risk Factors; Comorbidity; Heart Disease Risk Factors"
"39300751","Whole-body volume of oxygen consumption while walking: Agreement between measured and estimated values.","Predictive equations are widely employed for estimating the volume of oxygen consumption (VO2) while walking, which is ultimately employed to determine energy expenditure and tailor exercise prescription. This study aimed to test the agreement between the measured VO2 and estimated VO2 during a walking protocol on a treadmill at 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 km/h. Thirty-eight young adults (50% women) participated in this cross-sectional study. The Omnical (Maastricht Instruments, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and K5 (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) metabolic systems were used to measure VO2. To determine the predictive equations, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE database from May 2022 to July 2023. Seven predictive equations were found and included for estimating VO2 values. We calculated the mean bias (mean difference between measured VO2 and estimated VO2) obtained at each speed using one-sample t-tests. We compared the VO2 measured and estimated values using repeated measures analysis of variance and the Bland-Altman method. One-sample t-tests showed that all score errors were different from zero (ranging from 1.1 to 5.4 mL/kg/min). Thus, no predictive equation estimated similar VO2 values in comparison with the Omnical and K5 metabolic systems at all intensities. However, the Weyand equation showed the lowest bias across all intensities (score error of 1.1 mL/kg/min). This study showed a lack of agreement between the Omnical and K5 systems compared to diverse predictive equations specially designed to estimate VO2 during walking. Nevertheless, based on our results, the Weyand equation should be the preferred option.","Antonio Clavero-Jimeno, Andres Marmol-Perez, Manuel Dote-Montero, Jonatan R Ruiz, Juan M A Alcantara","European journal of sport science","2024Sep19",NA

Patients with T2D (aged ≥18 years) were identified during the study period (2014-2020) from medical claims of 4.5 million publicly insured German residents and divided into different cohorts based on CVD and/or obesity diagnosis. Annual prevalence and incidence were estimated for each study year, while characteristics and treatments were assessed in 2020. Data were extrapolated to the German population by age and sex. The prevalence of T2D in 2020 was 11.4%. Among patients with T2D, 53.0% had CVD, 39.3% had obesity, and 20.9% had CVD and obesity. Since 2014, CVD increased by 1.4%, obesity by 4.5%, and CVD with obesity by 2.7% in patients with T2D. The incidence of T2D in 2020 was 1.0% (42.9% had CVD, 37.9% had obesity, and 15.8% had CVD and obesity).

"39300620","CASEMIX study: Assessment of patient factors influencing the subprocedure duration of trauma/orthopaedic surgeries.","The social and financial burdens of the operative environment remains to be a major problem in modern society. We analyse the impact of the introduction and application of a perioperative cloud system that cross-analyzes the pre-/intraoperative risks to minimize surgical time and maximize operation theater efficiency through improved planning. TCC-CASEMIX© was introduced to our Department of Trauma Surgery of the University of Szeged to objectively measure intraoperative time durations according to each essential subprocedure. The study is largely divided into pre-operative assessments and intraoperative measurements. Patient data (age, sex, and ethnicity etc.) was registered preoperatively, and the expected time per each essential intraoperative step (skin incision, reduction, fixation etc.) was entered. The steps were then timed intraoperatively by surveyors, and postoperative cross analysis was performed. Our study was divided into two phases; phase 1, the surveying of general trauma / orthopedic cases, and phase two; the examination of high volume surgeries. Acute cases of Open Reductions and Internal Fixation (ORIF) procedures depended heavily on the presentation of the fracture, and no clear correlations in the risk factors were found. Arthroscopies were a short, high-volume procedure, but there was a large difference between the surgeon's estimates and the operation duration. In high volume surgeries, although individual factors only slightly influenced surgical duration, patient cohort stratification led to a better understanding of factors that impact surgeries, namely the combination of BMI and surgeon years of experience. While the average (Intraoperative Duration) seemed to increase with BMI, younger surgeons were more influenced by the patients BMI. A data filtering algorithm-assisted cloud system can be a reliable way to facilitate the planning of operating theater schedules. Patient stratification according to BMI and surgeon years of experience seems to affect intraoperative duration significantly, and the understanding of the risks and intraoperative steps has the potential to forecast surgeries with high precision.","Takayuki Kurokawa, Yujin Kaneko, Ashish Varughese Mammen, Victoria Walls, Ivan Diogo Queiros, Federica Corbo, Mais Azaizah, Matthew Bacon, Endre Varga, László Török","Injury","2024Sep","Humans; Male; Female; Operative Time; Adult; Middle Aged; Orthopedic Procedures; Risk Factors; Fractures, Bone; Fracture Fixation, Internal"

However, there are few comparisons of HRQoL at several time points for women with BC, and particular when subdivided into invasive and in situ tumors. The purpose of this study was to investigate various aspects of HRQoL in women recently diagnosed with invasive BC or ductal carcinoma in situ (in situ) compared to age-matched BC free controls in a population-wide sample recruited through the Cancer Registry of Norway. This cross-sectional study utilized HRQoL data collected in 2020-2022 from a digital survey including 4117 cases (3867 women with invasive BC and 430 with in situ) and 2911 controls. HRQoL was assessed ≥ 21 days after diagnosis, using EORTC QLQ-C30. This includes scores assessing global quality of life (gHRQoL) and HRQoL functions and symptoms. Multivariable regression analyses were used to compare HRQoL between cases and controls and to identify factors associated with gHRQoL and fatigue. Additionally, HRQoL 14 months after diagnosis was analyzed in 1989 of the included cases and in 1212 of the controls. Score differences of ≥ 10 points were considered clinically relevant and thus presented in the results. Invasive BC cases had lower gHRQoL, role- and social functioning in addition to more fatigue than controls. In situ cases had lower role-and social functioning than controls. Invasive BC cases scored worse than in situ on all domains, but the differences were not considered clinically relevant. Physical activity was associated with better gHRQoL and less fatigue in invasive BC, in situ and controls. Both invasive BC and in situ cases improved their role- and social functioning scores from diagnosis to 14 months follow-up, however no improvement was seen for fatigue. Women with invasive BC and in situ reported lower role- and social functioning scores than controls right after diagnosis with improvements 14 months after diagnosis. Physical activity was associated with better gHRQoL and less fatigue and should, whenever possible, play a key role in the care for BC patients.","Synne K H Bøhn, Karianne Svendsen, A Balto, Ylva Maria Gjelsvik, Tor Åge Myklebust, Elin Børøsund, Hege R Eriksen, A Meland, K Østby, L Solberg Nes, Cecilie E Kiserud, Kristin V Reinertsen, G Ursin","Journal of patient-reported outcomes","2024Sep17","Humans; Quality of Life; Female; Breast Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Norway; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Fatigue; Breast Carcinoma In Situ; Registries"
"39297962","Safety and effectiveness of intraosseous regional prophylactic antibiotics in total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Intraosseous regional administration (IORA) as a widely applicable and clinically valuable route of administration has gained significant attention in the context of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the prophylactic administration of antibiotics. However, there is still controversy regarding its effectiveness and safety. The latest meta-analysis reports that the use of IORA for antibiotics in TKA is as safe and effective as IV administration in preventing prosthetic joint infection (PJI), but they did not separate the statistics for primary TKA and revision TKA, which may be inappropriate. There is currently a lack of evidence specifically comparing the outcomes of prophylactic antibiotic administration via IORA or IV route in primary/revision TKA, respectively, and new research evidence has emerged. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary objective of comparing the local drug tissue concentration and the incidence of PJI between preoperative IORA and intravenous (IV) administration of prophylactic antibiotics in TKA. Additionally, the occurrence of complications between the two administration routes was also compared. This meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement (PRISMA) guidelines. Retrospective cohort studies and prospective randomized controlled trials that utilized intraosseous local drug delivery for prophylactic antibiotics in knee arthroplasty were included. English literature from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was searched from the inception of each database until December 2023. Two researchers independently screened the literature, assessed the quality, and extracted data according to the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were local antibiotic tissue concentration and postoperative PJI incidence, while the secondary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative complications. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. This study included 7 prospective randomized controlled trials and 5 retrospective cohort studies. A total of 4091 patients participated in the 12 included studies, with 1,801 cases receiving IORA and 2,290 cases in the control group. In terms of local drug tissue concentration, intraosseous infusion (IO) 500 mg vancomycin significantly increased the drug concentration in the periarticular adipose tissue (SMD: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.87-1.84; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) and bone tissue (SMD: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49-1.40; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) compared to IV 1 g vancomycin. Regarding the incidence of postoperative PJI after primary TKA, IO 500 mg vancomycin was more effective in reducing the occurrence of PJI compared to IV 1 g vancomycin (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.59; P < 0.001; I2 = 36%). Finally, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 0.22-13.69; P = 0.59; I2 = 0%) and vancomycin-related complications (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.25-1.19; P = 0.44; I2 = 0%). Preoperative prophylactic antibiotic administration via IORA in TKA significantly increases local drug tissue concentration without significantly increasing systemic drug-related complications compared to traditional IV administration. In primary TKA, low-dose vancomycin via IORA is more effective in reducing the incidence of PJI compared to traditional IV regimens. However, its effectiveness remains controversial in high-risk populations for PJI, such as obese, diabetic, and renal insufficiency patients, as well as in revision TKA.","Muyang Yu, Zhanqi Wei, Xingdong Yang, Yiming Xu, Wei Zhu, Xisheng Weng, Bin Feng","Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery","2024Sep19",NA
"39297959","Influence of dental status on postoperative complications in major visceral surgical and organ transplantation procedures-the bellydent retrospective observational study.","The significance of dental status and oral hygiene on a range of medical conditions is well-recognised. However, the correlation between periodontitis, oral bacterial dysbiosis and visceral surgical outcomes is less well established. To this end, we study sought to determine the influence of dental health and oral hygiene on the rates of postoperative complications following major visceral and transplant surgery in an exploratory, single-center, retrospective, non-interventional study. Our retrospective non-interventional study was conducted at the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany. Patients operated on between January 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled in the study based on inclusion (minimum age of 18 years, surgery at our Department, intensive care / IMC treatment after major surgery, availability of patient-specific preoperative dental status assessment, documentation of postoperative complications) and exclusion criteria (minor patients or legally incapacitated patients, lack of intensive care or intermediate care (IMC) monitoring, incomplete documentation of preoperative dental status, intestinal surgery with potential intraoperative contamination of the site by intestinal microbes, pre-existing preoperative infection, absence of data regarding the primary endpoints of the study). The primary study endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary study endpoints were: 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay, duration of intensive care stay, Incidence of infectious complications, the microbial spectrum of infectious complication. A bacteriology examination was added whenever possible (if and only if the examination was safe for the patient)for infectious complications. The final patient cohort consisted of 417 patients. While dental status did not show an influence (p = 0.73) on postoperative complications, BMI (p = 0.035), age (p = 0.049) and quick (p = 0.033) were shown to be significant prognostic factors. There was significant association between oral health and the rate of infectious complications for all surgical procedures (p = 0.034), excluding transplant surgery. However, this did not result in increased 30-day mortality rates, prolonged intensive care unit treatment or an increase in the length of hospital stay (LOS) for the cohort as a whole. In contrast there was a significant correlation between the presence of oral pathogens and postoperative complications for a group as a whole (p < 0.001) and the visceral surgery subgroup (p < 0.001). Whilst this was not the case in the cohort who underwent transplant surgery, there was a correlation between oral health and LOS in this subgroup (p = 0.040). Bacterial swabs supports the link between poor oral health and infectious morbidity. Dental status was a significant predictor of postoperative infectious complications in this visceral surgery cohort. This study highlights the importance preoperative dental assessment and treatment prior to major surgery, particularly in the case of elective surgical procedures. Further research is required to determine the effect of oral health on surgical outcomes in order to inform future practice.

In this study, we aimed to summarise the atlantodental space classification of patients with AAD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and explore their clinical characteristics. Preoperative 3T cervical MR images of patients who underwent posterior reduction and fixation surgery for non-traumatic AAD between 1 September 2012 and 31 July 2023 were collected. Two radiologists read and recorded the MRI results based on the standard protocol. The kappa value was used to evaluate intra- and inter-observer agreements. The patient's age, sex, body mass index, clinical symptoms, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, and visual analogue scale information were obtained from medical records. A total of 135 patients with AAD (mean age, 51.3 ± 14.0 years, 52 men) were included in the analysis. The inter-observer agreement between the two readers was 0.818 (P < 0.0001). The intra-observer consistencies were 0.882 (P < 0.0001) and 0.896 (P < 0.0001). Patients with inflexible tissue signs exhibit more irreducible in hyperextension position, and their range of motion of ADI is smaller. These patients were older and had a higher incidence of abnormal spinal cord signals and JOA scores.

"39302927","The risk of dyslipidemia on PLHIV associated with different antiretroviral regimens in Huzhou.","Dyslipidemia is increasingly common in people living with HIV (PLHIV), thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events and diminishing the quality of life for these individuals. The study of blood lipid metabolism of PLHIV has great clinical significance in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this study aims to examine the blood lipid metabolism status of HIV-infected patients in Huzhou before and after receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to explore the impact of different HAART regimens on dyslipidemia. PLHIV confirmed in Huzhou from June 2010 to June 2022 was included. The baseline characteristics and clinical data during the follow-up period were collected, including some blood lipid indicators (total cholesterol and triglycerides) and HAART regimens. A multivariate logistic regression model and the generalized estimating equation model were used to analyze the independent effects of treatment regimens on the risk of dyslipidemia. The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia among PLHIV after HAART was 70.11%. PLHIV receiving lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine (AZT) had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia compared to those receiving 3TC+EFV+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). In a logistic analysis adjusted for important covariates such as BMI, age, diabetes status, etc., we found that the risks of dyslipidemia were higher with 3TC+EFV+AZT (dyslipidemia: odds ratio [OR] = 2.09, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.28-3.41; TG ≥1.7: OR = 2.40, 95%Cl:1.50-3.84) than with 3TC+EFV+TDF. Furthermore, on PLHIV that was matched 1:1 by the HAART regimens, the results of the generalized estimation equation again showed that 3TC+EFV+AZT (TG ≥1.7: OR = 1.84, 95%Cl: 1.10-3.07) is higher for the risk of marginal elevations of TG than 3TC+EFV+TDF. The prevalence of dyslipidemia varies according to different antiretroviral regimens. Using both horizontal and longitudinal data, we have repeatedly demonstrated that AZT has a more adverse effect on blood lipids than TDF from two perspectives. Therefore, we recommend caution in using the 3TC+EFV+AZT regimen for people at clinical risk of co-occurring cardiovascular disease.","Yanan Wang, Zhongrong Yang, Jing Li, Zhenqian Wu, Xiaoqi Liu, Hui Wang, Yuxin Chen, Ziyi Wang, Zhaowei Tong, Xiaofeng Li, Feilin Ren, Meihua Jin, Guangyun Mao","PloS one","2024","Humans; Dyslipidemias; HIV Infections; Male; Female; Adult; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Middle Aged; China; Benzoxazines; Lamivudine; Cyclopropanes; Alkynes; Anti-HIV Agents; Zidovudine; Risk Factors; Tenofovir; Prevalence"

It is of interest to study the specific features of the disease in these patients. To identify the main characteristics of acute gynecomastia in adult men. A continuous one-stage study including 160 adult males with acute onset gynecomastia, who were he was treated in Endocrinology Research Centre, Moscow. Total bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, creatinine, urea, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, sex hormone binding globulin, estradiol, total testosterone, alpha-fetoprotein, chorionic gonadotropin and mammary gland condition were evaluated in all patients. Baseline significance threshold level of p&lt;0.05. The incidence of gynecomastia increased from 5,4% in 2020 to 14,4% in 2024. Tumor forms of gynecomastia were rare, with 1,2% (95% CI 0,0; 3,0) of cases. In 30% (95% CI 22,9; 37,1) of men, gynecomastia was due to the intake of anabolic steroids for athletic stimulation. In 11,2% (95% CI 6,4; 16,1) of patients, gynecomastia was hepatogenic. In 7,5% (95% CI 3,4; 11,6), it was due to elevated sex hormone binding globulin. 47,5% (95% CI 39,8; 55,2) were endocrine non-tumorigenic form of gynecomastia due to excess body weight with formation of changes in sex hormone levels. The patients who took anabolic steroids were characterized by young age, as well as decreased luteinizing hormone levels and increased testosterone levels. The group of patients with elevated sex hormone binding globulin had no clinically significant features. Men from the group of hepatogenic gynecomastia were characterized by hyperestrogenism. Patients in the group with altered sex hormone levels were characterized by high body mass index and either increased estradiol or decreased testosterone or a combination of both. The number of adult male patients with acute gynecomastia is progressively increasing. In the examined sample of patients, the main causes of gynecomastia were patients taking anabolic steroids, liver dysfunction and weight gain with the formation of changes in sex hormone levels. Patients taking anabolic steroids were characterized by a drug--induced increase in testosterone and estradiol levels, which was accompanied by suppression of pituitary gonadotropic function. Estradiol elevation was also characteristic of patients with hepatogenic form of gynecomastia and men with excess body weight with formation of changes in sex hormone levels.","S Kh Eristavi, R V Rozhivanov, L V Nikankina, G S Kolesnikova, E R Rozhivanova, E N Andreeva, G A Mel'nichenko, N G Mokrysheva","Problemy endokrinologii","2024Sep16","Humans; Gynecomastia; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Testosterone; Incidence"

Recently, there is increasing evidence linking obesity with the functional state of the intestinal microbiota. The understanding of this relationship may provide new approaches to the treatment of obesity by manipulating the qualitative and quantitative parameters of intestinal bacterial-fungal associations. To study the features of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the colon microbiota and to evaluate associations with anamnestic, anthropometric and biochemical parameters in young obese patients. A single-center, cross-sectional, single-stage, controlled study was conducted with the participation of 118 young people, of whom 87 were obese, and 31 people with normal body weight formed the control group. All participants underwent a biochemical blood test (total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, uric acid, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein), as well as an assessment of the state of the colon microbiota using polymerase chain reaction in real time using a set of Colonoflor-16 (premium) reagents. The Microsoft Excel 2010 and IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 application software package was used for statistical calculations. The results were evaluated as statistically significant at a level of p&lt;0.05. Analyzing the result of Colonoflor-16 premium, the discrepancy between the obtained data of the control group and the reference values of the analysis was revealed. There was a clear tendency to decrease the content of Lactobacillus spp and Bifidobacterium spp in the obesity group. In addition, in comparison with the control group (10.3%), in the obesity group Fusobacterium nucleatum significantly prevailed (37.6%) (p=0.005), with a significant decrease in the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p=0.030), and an increase in the bacteria Prevotella spp (p=0.029). A lot of associations of representatives of the colon microbiota with the most important anamnestic, anthropometric and biochemical parameters were revealed in young obese patients. There is a redistribution of microbiota phylotypes characterized by a decrease in apathogenic microorganisms and the appearance and increase of opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms, which generally indicates the formation of the pro-inflammatory potential of dominants and associates in young obese patients. The presence of statistically significant correlations strongly indicates of existence of close and diverse relationships between the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the microbiota and the metabolic parameters of patients.","T S Dushina, L A Suplotova, S M Klyashev, M V Nikolenko, E F Dorodneva","Problemy endokrinologii","2024Sep16","Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Female; Male; Obesity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adolescent; Adult; Young Adult"

This pathological condition has taken on the scale of a global epidemic in recent years, which continues to progress steadily, currently affecting more than 2 billion people worldwide. Due to its heterogeneity, obesity has a negative impact on the work of almost all organs and systems of the body, contributing to the emergence of new concomitant diseases and pathological conditions that significantly worsen the quality of life of these patients. Thus, a close relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and cognitive impairment has long been known, as well as with a number of other somatic diseases: coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, malignant neoplasms and other associated pathological conditions against the background of overweight and obesity.Currently, the problem of the relationship of cognitive impairment in patients with overweight or changes in the glycemic profile is very relevant, due to the high prevalence and insufficient study of this issue.","F Kh Dzgoeva, E V Ekusheva, V V Demidova","Problemy endokrinologii","2024Sep16","Humans; Obesity; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Quality of Life"

To identify early-life risk factors for preclinical atherosclerosis in adolescence. This cohort study is part of the ongoing Wheezing Illness Study in Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER) prospective birth cohort study, which includes 3005 healthy newborns born between December 2001 and December 2012 in the Leidsche Rijn area of Utrecht, the Netherlands. Eligible participants included those from the WHISTLER cohort who visited the clinic between March 2019 and October 2020 for adolescent follow-up. This study's analyses were performed in January 2024. Early-life growth was assessed at birth to 6 months, 5 years, and 12 to 16 years. Abdominal ultrasonography determined abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) depth. Blood pressure (BP) percentiles and body mass index (BMI) z scores were used. Carotid ultrasonography was performed at age 12 to 16 years to assess carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and the distensibility coefficient (DC), established measures of preclinical atherosclerosis. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify early-life risk factors for cIMT and DC in adolescence. In total, 232 adolescents (median [IQR] age, 14.9 [13.7-15.8] years; 121 female [52.2%]) were included. More postnatal weight gain (B = 12.34; 95% CI, 2.39 to 22.39), higher systolic BP at 5 years (B = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.01), more VAT at 5 years (B = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.55 to 5.40), and a larger change in VAT between 5 and 12 to 16 years (B = 3.13; 95% CI, 1.87 to 4.39) were associated with a higher cIMT in adolescence. A higher BMI (B = -2.70, 95% CI,-4.59 to -0.80) and VAT at 5 years (B = -0.56; 95% CI, -0.87 to -0.25), as well as a larger change in BMI between 5 and 12 to 16 years (B = -3.63; 95% CI, -5.66 to -1.60) were associated with a higher carotid stiffness in adolescence. On the contrary, a larger change in SAT between 5 and 12 to 16 years (B = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.58) was associated with a higher carotid DC in adolescence. In this cohort study of 232 participants, early-life growth parameters, and particularly abdominal VAT development, were associated with a higher cIMT and carotid stiffness in adolescence. These findings suggest that assessment of adipose tissue development during childhood can aid characterization of lifetime risk trajectories and tailoring of cardiovascular prevention and risk management strategies.","Isabelle A van der Linden, Rozan Roodenburg, Sanne L Nijhof, Cornelis K van der Ent, Roderick P Venekamp, Sabine E I van der Laan, Henk S Schipper","JAMA network open","2024Sep03","Humans; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Female; Adolescent; Male; Vascular Stiffness; Risk Factors; Child; Prospective Studies; Netherlands; Infant, Newborn; Infant; Child, Preschool; Atherosclerosis; Body Mass Index"
"39302621","Maternal and fetal risk factors for congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract: a birth cohort study in urban China.","Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are among the most common causes of kidney diseases in children. Previous studies on CAKUT etiologies have been predominantly focused on non-modifiable genetic risk factors. The existing nongenetic studies are limited by lack of comprehensive investigation of potentially modifiable risk factors and the inability to distinguish among various phenotypes of CAKUT. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate both maternal and fetal risk factors of CAKUT, sorted by disease phenotype. A prospective birth cohort study was conducted among 10,179 women who delivered a singleton live newborn in Lanzhou, China, between 2010 and 2012. Face-to-face interviews were conducted among the participants within 1-3 days after delivery using standard questionnaires to collect information on maternal demographics and characteristics. All newborns underwent postnatal renal ultrasonographic screening during their routine 1-month checkup. Clinical data, including birth outcomes and maternal complications, were confirmed by reviewing their medical records. Maternal and fetal risk factors were compared in children with and without CAKUT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors of CAKUT and their phenotypes, respectively. A total of 489 (4.8%) cases of CAKUT were identified. Logistic regression revealed that maternal overweight (pre-pregnancy), gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birth weight were independent risk factors for CAKUT. Maternal overweight increased the risk of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, odds ratio (OR) = 1.441, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.010-2.057) and posterior urethral valves (PUV, OR = 1.868, 95% CI 1.074-3.249). Gestational diabetes increased the risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO, OR = 1.269; 95% CI 1.044-1.543) and posterior urethral valves (OR = 1.794; 95% CI 1.302-2.474). Preterm birth increased the risk of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (OR = 1.056; 95% CI 1.004-1.111). Our study identified various risk factors associated with different CAKUT phenotypes, stressing the importance of separate analyses for each phenotype. Our findings may provide helpful guidance on developing targeted and effective CAKUT prevention programs in the future.","Wei Zhang, Xiaochun Zhou, Weikai Wang, Li Wang, Chuan Zhang, Jianqin Wang","Journal of nephrology","2024Sep20",NA

Despite their recognized benefits in glycemic control and weight management, their impact on broader systemic has been less explored. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RAs on a variety of systemic diseases in people with T2D or obesity. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Global Collaborative Network, accessed through the TriNetX analytics platform. The study comprised two primary groups: individuals with T2D and those with obesity. Each group was further divided into subgroups based on whether they received GLP-1RA treatment or not. Data were analyzed over more than a 5-year follow-up period, comparing incidences of systemic diseases; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ulcerative colitis (UC), crohn's disease (CD), alzheimer's disease (AD), parkinson's disease (PD), dementia, bronchial asthma (BA), osteoporosis, and several cancers. In the T2D cohorts, GLP-1RA treatment was associated with significantly lower incidences of several systemic and metabolic conditions as compared to those without GLP-1RA, specifically, dementia (Risk Difference (RD): -0.010, p < 0.001), AD (RD: -0.003, p < 0.001), PD (RD: -0.002, p < 0.001), and pancreatic cancer (RD: -0.003, p < 0.001). SLE and SS also saw statistically significant reductions, though the differences were minor in magnitude (RD: -0.001 and - 0.000 respectively, p < 0.001 for both). Conversely, BA a showed a slight increase in risk (RD: 0.002, p < 0.001). GLP-1RAs demonstrate potential benefits in reducing the risk of several systemic conditions in people with T2D or obesity. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these effects fully and understand the mechanisms.","Mahmoud Nassar, Omar Nassar, Hazem Abosheaishaa, Anoop Misra","Journal of endocrinological investigation","2024Sep20",NA

The confounding factors included age, body mass index, and alcohol intake. Multiple regression analysis revealed that TMDs (β value = 0.293, p = 0.034) and stress (β value = 1.3, p < 0.001) were significantly correlated with the PSQI total score. In addition, TMDs were significantly correlated with stress (β value = 0.076, p = 0.007).

This study evaluated the success rate of CPAP initiation via this voucher. We selected patients from our sleep apnea clinic referred to CPAP initiation aged 18-80 years with no significant physical or psychological comorbidity. Three private clinics (A, B, C) accepted the CPAP voucher. A total of 1922 patients fulfilled CPAP voucher criteria. Of these, we included 1604 patients (38% women).

This study aims to investigate factors associated with multiple medication use during pregnancy, as well as any increased risk of pregnancy complications for women taking multiple medications. A retrospective analysis of routinely collected medical records of singleton pregnant women was conducted in Southeast Melbourne, Australia, between 2016 and 2021. Self-reported medication use was recorded as part of routine medical care, starting from the first antenatal booking appointment and continuing for every subsequent antenatal appointment until birth. Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more medical conditions. Logistic regression was used to assess factors influencing multiple medication use (defined as taking two or more non-supplemental medications at any stage of pregnancy) and associations with pregnancy complications. Of 48,502 participants, 34.9% used one medication, while 11.7% used multiple medications. Women of older age (30-34, 35-39, and ≥  40 years), higher body mass index (25.0-29.9 kg/m2 and ≥  30 kg/m2), born in Australasia and Oceania, higher socioeconomic status, and multimorbidity were more likely to use multiple medications during pregnancy. Women taking multiple medications had a higher risk of preterm and caesarean deliveries, fetal death, and neonatal admissions to intensive care. Sensitivity analyses exploring different morbidity categories produced no changes to findings. Medication use during pregnancy is prevalent, with many pregnant mothers taking multiple medications. Given the rising maternal age, body mass index, and morbidities in pregnancy, the use of medications during pregnancy is increasing. Such use correlates with an increased chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the context of limited trials on the safety and efficacy of medications in pregnancy, timely harnessing of the information available within routine medical records for post-marketing surveillance is important.","Yitayeh Belsti, Aya Mousa, Hannah Jackson, Lisa J Moran, Kirsten R Palmer, Raja Ram Dhungana, Emily Callander, Daniel Lorber Rolnik, Helena Teede, Joanne Enticott","Drug safety","2024Sep20",NA
"39302463","The application of the ""perinephric fat wrapping"" technique with oral mucosal graft for the management of ureter repair and reconstruction.","The management of long-segment ureteral stenosis has posed a significant challenge for urologists. Ureteroplasty with oral mucosal graft has emerged as an effective approach for treating long-segment ureteral stenosis and defects. A key step in replacement repair surgery involves suturing the surrounding tissue with an adequate blood supply around the reconstructed ureter. The current study aims to evaluate the potential practical application of the ""perinephric fat wrapping"" technique in laparoscopic ureteroplasty with oral mucosal graft. Between July 2018 and February 2023, 26 patients with ureteral stenosis underwent laparoscopic ureteroplasty with oral mucosal graft at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. We used traditional omental wrapping technique (OW group) or perinephric fat wrapping technique (PFW group) to enhance ureter repair. Perioperative and follow-up data for both groups were collected retrospectively and compared. There were 10 patients in OW group, including 4 males and 6 females, with BMI of 23.5±2.8 kg/m2 and stenosis length of 3.6±1.6 cm. There were 16 patients in the PFW group, including 10 males and 6 females, with a BMI of 26.1±3.3 kg/m2 and a median stenosis length of 2.3 cm (range, 1.2~6.0 cm). The operation of both groups was successfully completed, and no serious complications occurred during the operation. The mean operating time (OT) in the OW group was 200.6±41.9 min, the estimated amount of blood loss (EBL) was 25 ml (range, 10~30ml), and the median length of postoperative hospital stay (LHS) was 7.5 days (range 4.0~14.0 days). In the PFW group, the mean operating time (OT) was 211.9±38.3 min, the estimated blood loss (EBL) was 25 ml (range, 5~150ml), and the postoperative hospital stay (LHS) was 6.8±2.0 d. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the above indexes. Postoperative anal exhaust time was 1.0 d (range, 1.0~2.5d) in the PFW group and 1.9±0.5 d in the OW group, with significant difference between the two groups (P=0.009). The mean follow-up time was 36.8±15.9 months, and there was no significant difference between OW group and PFW group in the curative effect of operation. Perinephric fat wrapping technique not only avoids the potential effects of using omentum on abdominal organs, it is also as safe and effective as omentum wrapping technique in repairing and reconstructing the ureter using oral mucosal grafts.","Yu Jiang, Chao Yang, Lu Fang, Ruilong Chen, Xiang Li, Chao Jiang, Wei Hu, Hengbao Chen, Dexin Yu, Yi Wang","World journal of urology","2024Sep20","Humans; Male; Female; Mouth Mucosa; Retrospective Studies; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Middle Aged; Ureter; Adult; Ureteral Obstruction; Plastic Surgery Procedures; Adipose Tissue; Laparoscopy"

Here, LD was investigated in various disease and in presence of a unilateral carotid stent. Carotid acquisitions were performed by ultrasound imaging on both body sides of 75 participants (150 Arteries). LD was measured in its percent quantity and direction. Obesity (p = 0.001) and carotid plaques (p = 0.01) were independently associated to quantity decrease of LD in the whole population. In a subgroup analysis, it was respectively 143% in healthy (n = 48 carotids), 129% (n = 34) in presence of cardiovascular risk factors, 121% (n = 20) in MACE patients, 119% (n = 24) in the carotid contralateral to a stent, 110% (n = 24) in carotids with stents. Regarding the direction of LD, in a subgroup analysis an inverted movement was identified in aged (p = 0.001) and diseased (p = 0.001) participants who also showed less quantity of LD (p = 0.001), but independently with age only (p = 0.002) in the whole population. This observational study suggests that LD within carotid wall layers is lower additively with ageing, cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, and stent. Even if stent is surely beneficial, these data might shed some light on stent restenosis, emphasising the need for interventional studies.","Claudio Carallo, Michela Destito, Paolo Zaffino, Chiara Caglioti, Vittorio Silipo, Paolo Maria De Masi, Agostino Gnasso, Maria Francesca Spadea","Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation","2024Sep14",NA

We evaluated three targets according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations: treatment (glucose-lowering drugs, statins, antihypertensive drugs, and aspirin); metabolism (blood glucose, body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol); and lifestyle (non-smoking, non-drinking, physical activity, and diet). We used multivariable Poisson regression models to assess sociodemographic factors influencing adherence to guideline recommendations. The study included 110 083 participants, of whom 6789 (6.0%) had self-reported diabetes. The prevalence of achieving the treatment, metabolic and lifestyle targets for all components were 9.9%, 8.1%, and 7.2%, respectively. The components with the lowest prevalence of the three targets were 11.1% for statin use, 27.3% for body mass index control, and 19.5% for sufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables, respectively. Upper-middle-income countries were better at achieving the treatment, non-drinking, and dietary targets than lower-middle-income countries. Women, middle-aged and older patients, and highly educated patients had a lower prevalence of metabolic adherence. In LMICs, the prevalence of patients with diabetes meeting WHO-recommended treatment, metabolic and lifestyle targets for CVD prevention was low. Our findings highlighted the need to strengthen the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes in LMICs.","Yang Li, Minghai Yan, Qiujing Cai, Lap Ah Tse, Zhiguang Liu, Xinyue Lang, Biyan Wang, Qiuyan Ma, Mengya Li, Qi Qiu, Wei Li","Journal of global health","2024Sep20","Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Adult; Diabetes Mellitus; Aged; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Guideline Adherence"
